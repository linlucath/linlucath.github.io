Thank you Sam. So when I looked through the syllabus of this class and thought about what I could possibly add that would be useful in addition to the various skills, one of the things that I had been thinking about had been: how do you think about yourself as founder, how do you think about what the skill set is? And what are the things that you should be thinking about in terms of am I ready, how do I get ready, is it the right thing for me? These sorts of things. So let's start with the perception of what a great founder is. And classically, you know, this tends to be Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos. And it's an image of founder as superwoman or superman right, who has this like panopticon of skills. I can use the word panopticon because I'm here at Stanford. But it's things like: I know how to do product market fit, I'm great at product, I'm great at strategy, I'm great at management, I can fundraise. I can do all of these different skills. And a part of what you're looking for in a great founder, in the kind of theory of the founder as superperson, is I'm looking for someone who is awesome at all these things. They are well rounded, they are diverse, they can bat on all skills. And you know, part of how I found this kind of emphasized in my own, the beginning of my own entrepreneurial journey, is I remember reading an article that said: you know, Bill Gates, who is smarter than Einstein, right? And you're like, well look, Bill Gates is really smart and he's very accomplished. But I'm not quite sure smarter than Einstein is actually a phrase that even Bill would want to be actually next to.

谢谢萨姆。当我浏览这门课程的教学大纲，思考除了各种技能之外我还能补充什么有用的内容时，我一直在思考的一个问题是：作为创始人，你如何看待自己？你如何看待所需技能组合？你应该思考哪些问题，比如我准备好了吗？我该如何准备？这对我来说是正确的选择吗？诸如此类的问题。让我们从对优秀创始人的认知开始。传统上，这往往指向史蒂夫·乔布斯、比尔·盖茨、埃隆·马斯克、马克·扎克伯格、杰夫·贝索斯。这是一种将创始人视为超人或超女的形象，他们拥有全方位的技能。我可以用"全方位"这个词，因为我在斯坦福大学。但这就像：我知道如何实现产品市场匹配，我擅长产品，我擅长战略，我擅长管理，我能融资。我能掌握所有这些不同的技能。在寻找优秀创始人时，在将创始人视为超人的理论中，我们寻找的是在所有方面都表现出色的人。他们全面发展，多才多艺，能在所有技能上都有所建树。在我自己的创业旅程初期，我深切体会到这种观点的强化。我记得读过一篇文章说，比尔·盖茨比爱因斯坦更聪明，对吧？你会想，比尔·盖茨确实很聪明，成就非凡。但我不太确定"比爱因斯坦更聪明"这个说法是否真的是比尔本人愿意接受的评价。

And it's partially because I think it's this image of founder as superperson, which is that a great founder is someone who can do anything, you know, jump over tall buildings in a single bound, all of these sorts of things. And the reality is the founder is someone who deals with a ton of different headaches. And no one is universally super powered. Generally speaking, you hope to have a couple of super powers. Some things that are unique edge to you. Some things that are unique to the problem that you are trying to solve. Some things that may help you give an edge because actually competitive differentiation and competitive edge is super important. But it's not actually in fact a function of genius. And matter of fact frequently it's very hard to tell the difference between madness and genius, because usually it's the results that play out. And sometimes when you're dealing with uncertain environments, you may even be genius and later be thought to be a mad person. Or you may be a mad person and you turn out to be lucky. And you're later thought to be a genius. So it's actually a kind of challenging set of how do you think about these sets, what is the whole set of skills and what us mere mortals come into this kind of battle what is the right way to think about it? And so when I thought about this question of how is one a great founder, part of what you get to is.

部分原因在于我认为这是一种将创始人视为超人的形象，即伟大的创始人应该是无所不能的人，能够一跃跳过摩天大楼，诸如此类的事情。而现实是，创始人需要应对大量不同的难题。没有人是全能超能的。一般来说，你希望拥有几项超能力。一些对你来说独特的优势。一些与你试图解决的问题相关的独特之处。一些可能帮助你获得优势的东西，因为实际上竞争差异化和竞争优势非常重要。但这实际上并非天才的功能。事实上，经常很难区分疯狂与天才，因为通常只有结果才能说明一切。有时当你在不确定的环境中，你可能是天才但后来被认为是疯子。或者你可能是疯子但结果很幸运，后来被认为是天才。所以这实际上是一组具有挑战性的问题：你如何看待这些技能组合，完整的技能组合是什么，我们这些凡夫俗子参与这种战斗时应该如何正确思考？因此，当我思考如何成为伟大创始人这个问题时，你得到的部分答案是。

Oh, and actually, this is probably the slide that for people on this, this may have been a suboptimal choice for people on video, but these are all skills that are super important. Right? These are all things that you say, well, okay, this is really, really important to do and you must in fact actually do this well, and it begins to look like a superhuman task. And so what I decided to do was take a subset of these and focused on some of the interesting things to think about: what is it that actually makes a great founder? Because it's actually not that you score ten out of ten on all these, you know, you're the entrepreneurial Olympiad. You are actually the best at all of these things. So let's start with team. So one way to kind of talk about exploding the myth of the super founder is that actually in fact usually it's best to have two or three people on a team rather than a solo founder. Not to say solo founders don't actually play out and they can be successful. But most often, two or three people is actually in fact a much better composition. When I look at these things as an investor, and I say, what is a good composition of a project and founders that are likely to succeed, it's usually there's two or three of them. The reasons are, for example we've already talked about the fact that there's this very broad set of skills. There's this whole set of question about how you adapt your company in order to be successful, and if you actually have two or three founders, you have different skills, you can compensate because, by the way, everyone has weaknesses. You can compensate for each other's weaknesses. You can in the diversity of problems that you encounter as a founder.

实际上，对在场观众来说，这张幻灯片可能不是最佳选择，但这些确实都是极其重要的技能。对吧？这些都是你会说"好吧，这确实非常非常重要，而且必须做好"的事情，开始看起来像超人才能完成的任务。因此我决定从中选取一部分，重点关注一些值得思考的有趣方面：究竟什么造就了优秀的创始人？因为实际上并不需要你在所有这些方面都拿到满分，不需要成为创业奥林匹克冠军，不需要在所有领域都是最优秀的。那么让我们从团队开始说起。打破"超级创始人"神话的一种方式是，实际上通常最好由两到三人组成团队，而不是单打独斗的创始人。不是说单打独斗的创始人就无法成功，他们确实可以成功。但大多数情况下，两到三人的组合实际上要好得多。当我以投资者的角度审视这些时，我会思考什么样的项目结构和创始人组合更可能成功，通常都是两到三人的团队。原因在于，比如我们已经讨论过技能范围非常广泛这个问题。关于如何调整公司以实现成功存在一系列问题，如果你有两到三位创始人，你们拥有不同的技能，可以互相弥补——毕竟每个人都有弱点。你们可以互相弥补对方的不足。在创始人遇到的各种各样问题中。

you encounter as a founder that

You can actually attack them. So one of the things that I suggest when you look at essentially a founding team is to have a real high preference for having co-founders, and having a high degree of trust with those co-founders. Because one of the things, by the way, part of the whole entrepreneurial thing is there's lots of ways to die. One of the ways to die is you get a year down the road with your co-founders and then you're going through a messy divorce. And that's not always but frequently fatal. And then also the diversity of the kind of tasks that you're trying to do.

实际上你可以攻击他们。所以当我建议你审视创始团队时，其中一个要点是要高度重视拥有联合创始人，并与这些联合创始人建立高度信任。因为创业过程中存在很多失败的可能。其中一种失败方式就是与联合创始人合作一年后，经历一场混乱的分手。这种情况虽然不总是但经常是致命的。此外还要考虑你所要完成任务的多样性。

Okay, yes, I was about to say that would be suboptimal from the viewpoint of being able to look at the slides. The next thing is location. And so frequently I've heard it told to me, it's like oh, Silicon Valley aggregates all of this super talent, which it does. In terms of what actually in fact, the reason why Silicon Valley startups are so successful is because all of these great people immigration, which is hugely important for talent and founders and everything else, you know, emigrate here. And that's part of the reason. Now, it's actually, if you think about it from basic math, even if you take something that Silicon Valley is super strong at, which is essentially software skills in the last two decades. Not all of the great software people move here.

好的，是的，我正要说从查看幻灯片的角度来看那将不是最佳选择。下一个因素是地理位置。我经常听到这样的说法，硅谷聚集了所有这些超级人才，确实如此。事实上，硅谷初创企业如此成功的原因是因为所有这些优秀人才的移民，这对人才、创始人等各方面都极其重要，他们都移民到这里。这是部分原因。实际上，如果你从基础数学角度思考，即使你考虑硅谷在过去二十年里特别擅长的软件技能领域，也并非所有优秀的软件人才都搬到这里。

Actually, the reason is because what great founders do is seek the networks that will be essential to their problem and their task. They realize that it isn't just about being a super person who can do this anywhere, even in the Antarctic. In order to be successful, I have to go to where the strongest networks are for the particular kind of problem or the particular kind of thing that I'm doing. Silicon Valley, by the way, is super good at some kind of tasks and solving certain kinds of problems, but it's not good at all of them. Let me take two examples. One is Groupon. I don't think Groupon could've ever been founded here. Even though it's a software product that actually generates a network, which obviously a lot of the great networks are here and uses Internet technology as a mobile product and everything else, all of which we have a lot of skills here in Silicon Valley and the networks are really good for this. One of the things that was central for Groupon in its early days was having massive sales forces, and massive sales forces strengths and weaknesses of networks tend to go together. Silicon Valley tends to be pretty adverse to plans that involve renting a 25-story building and having 20 floors of sales people, and that's how we're going to get our thing going. That kind of plan here tends to not get a lot of interest.

实际上，原因在于优秀的创始人会寻找对其问题和任务至关重要的网络。他们意识到这不仅仅是成为一个可以在任何地方（甚至南极）完成任务的超人。为了成功，我必须去那些针对特定问题或特定事务拥有最强网络的地方。顺便说一句，硅谷在某些任务和解决特定类型问题方面非常擅长，但并非所有方面都擅长。让我举两个例子。一个是Groupon。我认为Groupon永远不可能在这里创立。尽管它是一个软件产品，实际上还能生成网络，而且显然许多优秀的网络都在这里，并使用互联网技术作为移动产品等等，所有这些我们在硅谷都拥有丰富的技能，网络对此也非常有利。Groupon早期核心要素之一是拥有庞大的销售团队，而庞大销售团队的优势和网络的劣势往往是并存的。硅谷往往对那些涉及租用25层大楼、其中20层都是销售人员的计划相当反感，尽管这可能是我们启动业务的方式。这类计划在这里往往不会引起太多兴趣。

That kind of plan here tends to not get a lot of interest, tends to get a lot of criticism, tends to not have talent aggregate to it, tends to have financiers talk up things like capital efficiency and network effects and other kinds of things that are key here. And so it's actually not a surprise that Groupon was required to be in Chicago, which is really good at this as a way of actually getting going and showing that even software startups can be in other places. But even if you begin to think about what kinds of other startups would someone be an idiot to move here to do. Think of someone doing a fashion startup, not fashion a la Poshmark which is a mobile marketplace et cetera which are a bunch of things that are good here, but like developing and designing a new fashion company and coming to Silicon Valley to do it. That's actually not such a great idea. Not saying the fashion company might be a great idea, but you want the networks that support what you're doing. And so part of the reason why where I locate my startup is a test for thinking about am I a great founder is because part of what happens when you're actually founding a company is you're going to where it's successful to do it. The metaphor that I frequently use for entrepreneurship is jumping off a cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down, and the reason is because it's hard, it has a quasi-mortal exit by which you're default dead, and so you're taking every possible chance to actually win.

这类计划在这里往往不会获得太多关注，反而会招致大量批评，难以吸引人才聚集，往往会让金融家们强调资本效率、网络效应以及其他在此处至关重要的因素。因此，Groupon被要求设在芝加哥其实并不令人意外，因为芝加哥在这方面非常擅长，这实际上是一种起步方式，表明即使是软件初创公司也可以在其他地方发展。但即使你开始思考，什么样的其他初创公司会让搬到这里来做的人显得愚蠢。想象一下有人在做时尚初创公司，不是像Poshmark那样的时尚平台——那是一个移动市场等等，这些在这里都很合适——而是像开发和设计一个新的时尚公司，却要来硅谷做这件事。这实际上并不是个好主意。不是说时尚公司可能不是个好主意，而是你需要支持你事业发展的网络。因此，我选择初创公司所在地的部分原因是为了检验我是否是一位优秀的创始人，因为当你真正创办公司时，部分情况是你会去成功的地方做事。我经常用来比喻创业的说法是：跳下悬崖并在坠落过程中组装飞机，原因在于这很困难，它具有准致命性退出机制——你默认是死亡的，因此你要抓住每一个可能获胜的机会。

Great founders recognize the value of networks and often relocate accordingly. This concept is frequently associated with Silicon Valley. For text startups, mobile applications, network platforms, and marketplace businesses, it remains an excellent location. However, for various other ventures, you should carefully consider whether a different location might be more suitable.

Currently, it has become quite fashionable and conventional to claim contrarian views. Let's examine what being truly contrarian actually entails. It's relatively easy to adopt contrarian positions, but the challenge lies in being both contrarian and correct. When evaluating whether your idea is sufficiently contrarian, consider how intelligent individuals might disagree with you. If you cannot identify a knowledgeable expert who would raise substantive objections to your concept, then it likely isn't truly contrarian.

Contrarian perspectives are always relative to a specific audience. As Sam and I discussed at startup school, a strong contrarian idea in consumer internet, for example, would be something that established experts in the field currently consider unviable. The essence of contrarian thinking involves identifying what unique knowledge you possess that others lack.

优秀的创业者能够认识到网络的价值并相应调整自己的位置。这一概念经常与硅谷联系在一起。对于文本创业公司、移动应用、网络平台和市场业务而言，这里仍然是绝佳的选择。然而，对于其他各类企业，您应当仔细考虑不同地点是否更为合适。

当前，宣称持有逆向思维已经变得相当流行和常规。让我们探讨一下真正的逆向思维实际包含什么。采取逆向立场相对容易，但真正的挑战在于既保持逆向思维又保持正确。在评估您的想法是否足够逆向时，请考虑聪明人可能会如何反驳您。如果您无法找出能够对您的概念提出实质性反对意见的知识渊博的专家，那么它可能并非真正的逆向思维。

逆向观点总是相对于特定受众而言的。正如我和Sam在创业学校讨论过的，以消费互联网为例，一个强有力的逆向想法应该是该领域现有专家目前认为不可行的概念。逆向思维的本质在于识别您拥有哪些他人缺乏的独特认知。

Who isn't like ignorant or know? Because it isn't just that I'm brilliant and other people aren't, and that's the reason why contrarian thing is right. That's a very bad test. Right, it happened to be true. Of course, lightning could also strike you in the field. You know, so think a lot about what is that I know that other people don't know? For example, in the very early days of LinkedIn, part of what I advised all founders to do was go talk to every smart person who will talk to you and give you feedback. At LinkedIn I walked around and said here's my idea, what do you think? Two thirds or more of my network, including some of the very smart people, all thought I was nuts. The reason why they thought I was nuts was because they said well look, it's a network product, it's only valuable with a bunch of people in it. First person no value, invite second person, second person first person, no value for either of them, they already know each other. When do you actually begin to deliver on your use case, which is like 500k to a million people? Right. And so you're never going to get to size, you're never going to grow. Now what I knew that the critics didn't know was that I could think of a set of different ways by which people could say look it's pretty easy to say look I believe in the vision of this, or I think it's interesting, or I think a product like this should exist, or I'm willing to play around with it. And I can use, leverage those sets of interests to grow the network, to get to enough size that you could begin to deliver on the value propositions which LinkedIn had.

谁不是像无知或知道？因为这不仅仅是我很聪明而其他人不是，这就是为什么逆向思维正确的原因。那是个非常糟糕的测试。没错，它碰巧是正确的。当然，在田野里你也可能被闪电击中。你知道，所以要多多思考，我知道什么而别人不知道？例如，在LinkedIn的早期阶段，我建议所有创始人做的一件事就是去和每个愿意与你交谈并给予反馈的聪明人交流。在LinkedIn，我四处走动说这是我的想法，你觉得怎么样？我社交网络中三分之二或更多的人，包括一些非常聪明的人，都认为我疯了。他们认为我疯了的理由是，他们说看，这是一个网络产品，只有有很多人参与才有价值。第一个人没有价值，邀请第二个人，第二个人和第一个人，对双方都没有价值，他们已经认识彼此。你什么时候才能真正实现你的用例，这需要大约50万到100万人？没错。所以你永远达不到规模，你永远不会成长。现在我知道而批评者不知道的是，我可以想出一系列不同的方式让人们说，看，这很容易说，我相信这个愿景，或者我认为它很有趣，或者我认为这样的产品应该存在，或者我愿意尝试一下。我可以利用这些兴趣点来扩大网络规模，达到足够大的规模，从而开始实现LinkedIn所具有的价值主张。

And that was the specific thing that I knew that the critics weren't thinking about. And so when you think about being contrarian, you have to think about how is it that smart people disagree with me? They disagree with me from a position of intelligence right. And there's something that I know that they don't know that actually in fact will play out to be true. Now, in this case, in general as a founder it's good to be contrarian in the real sense and right. Now the other last part on the contrariness is to think about there's a lot of different ways to be contrarian. So for example, a frequent one will be is like, oh yeah, that's a good small idea but actually not so small it's large. Or you know, actually in fact you can assemble the talent or while most consumer internet start ups tend to be like for example, this is another LinkedIn example tend to be only successful through rocket ships. Actually a gradual compounding curve can actually be very, very valuable. LinkedIn never had its rocket ship moment. It was, it was kind of compound year by year. But that in the consumer internet, tends to be a atypical to the pattern. So here you begin to get to a bunch of sorts of problems that, essentially founders run into, which is like, well should I be doing the work or should be recruiting people and delegating the work. And classically the answer to this is, actually in fact you need to do both. Right, and, in fact, not only do you need to do both, you need to do sometimes one at 100% and sometimes the other one at 100%. And sometimes, even though this is not so good at math, both at 100%.

这正是我深知批评者们未曾考虑到的具体问题。因此，当你思考如何保持逆向思维时，必须考虑聪明人为何会与我意见相左？他们是从理性的立场来反对我的观点。而我掌握着他们不了解的信息，这些信息最终将被证实是正确的。总的来说，作为创始人，保持真正意义上的逆向思维且正确判断是有益的。关于逆向思维的最后一个要点是，存在多种不同的逆向思维方式。例如，常见的一种情况是：这个想法看似微小实则宏大。或者，实际上你能够组建人才团队，而大多数消费互联网初创企业往往像另一个领英案例那样，仅通过爆发式增长获得成功。实际上，渐进式的复利曲线可能极具价值。领英从未经历过爆发式增长时刻，它是逐年累积发展的。但在消费互联网领域，这种模式往往非典型。由此你会遇到创始人经常面临的一系列问题：我应该亲自执行工作，还是应该招聘人员并委派工作？传统答案是：实际上你需要两者兼顾。事实上，你不仅需要兼顾两者，有时需要全力以赴做好其中一项，有时又需要全力投入另一项。有时，尽管这在数学上不太合理，但需要同时百分之百地兼顾两者。

And so what you'll see is, this is actually classic when you begin thinking about what is a great founder. Is you navigate what is apparent paradoxes? So another one that I frequently talk about is, you got to be both flexible and persistent. The reason for this is, entrepreneurs are frequently given the advice to have a vision. Stay firm against adversity. Realize that you have this vision that is contrarian to what other people think, and just stay on track, get through the difficult times, and get there. The other piece of advice given with equal vigor is, listen to data, listen to customers. Pivot. Be flexible! Part of the thing this comes out to meaning in terms of being a great founder is to say well, when should I be persistent, when should I be flexible? The vehicle that I most often use for this is you should have on a project you're doing, like a company, an investment thesis that essentially says why you think possibly contrarian. Why you think this is a potentially good idea. It should include what you know that you think other people don't know and then, as you're going into the battlefield, you go is, am I in fact increasing confidence in my investment pieces or decreasing confidence in my investment pieces? Because I've got increasing confidence, then stay on track, be persistent. And by the way, sometimes even with adversity, your confidence can increase. If it's decreasing, that doesn't mean jump out. PayPal, LinkedIn, Airbnb, a whole bunch of startups I've been a part of have had months where you were like, oh my God this,

因此你会发现，当你开始思考什么是优秀的创始人时，这实际上是个经典问题。你是否能够驾驭那些显而易见的矛盾？我经常谈论的另一个矛盾是，你必须既灵活又坚持。原因是，创业者经常被建议要拥有愿景。面对逆境时要坚定。要认识到你的愿景与其他人想法相悖，只需保持航向，度过艰难时期，最终达成目标。另一个被同样强调的建议是，倾听数据，倾听客户。及时调整方向。保持灵活！这其中的关键在于，作为优秀创始人，你需要明确何时应该坚持，何时应该灵活？我最常使用的工具是，在你进行的项目（比如公司）中应该有一个投资论点，本质上说明你为什么认为这可能与主流观点相悖。为什么你认为这是个潜在的好主意。它应该包含你认为自己知道而别人不知道的信息，然后当你进入战场时，你要问自己：我实际上是在增加还是减少对投资论点的信心？如果信心在增加，那就保持航向，坚持到底。顺便说一句，有时即使面临逆境，你的信心也可能增加。如果信心在减少，这并不意味着要立即退出。PayPal、LinkedIn、Airbnb，以及我参与过的许多初创公司都经历过这样的月份，你会觉得，天啊这个，

oh my God this,

Why would we ever think this was a good idea? It was kind of a valley of the shadows moment. For example, in PayPal it was August 2000 we were burning $12 million in one month, the expense curve was exponentiating, we had no revenue, decrease in confidence. However we say okay what we do in order to fix that, and that gives you your immediate action plan.

我们怎么会认为这是个好主意呢？这有点像身处幽暗低谷的时刻。以PayPal为例，在2000年8月，我们一个月就烧掉了1200万美元，支出曲线呈指数级增长，我们没有收入，信心也在下降。但我们会说好吧，为了解决这个问题我们需要做什么，这就给出了你的即时行动计划。

Another question is whether you should have belief or fear. Should you essentially adhere to your vision of how the world should be and ignore everything else, pursuing it single-mindedly? Or should you be flexible across these lines? Sometimes you might be 90% one way, sometimes 80% the other way. You need to exercise judgment about what the current problem looks like. When trying to solve this, you should determine what we should be doing and how I should be dividing the work. When you think about these things, another classic example is when people say they are completely motivated by data - what customers say at user groups. Many entrepreneurial methodologies emphasize gathering data and being guided by it. However, data only exists within the framework of the vision you're building, a hypothesis of where you're moving. The data can even be negative, and you might think that this negative data means you need to change or alter your thinking about something. But I actually maintain a specific vision about what I'm doing. By the way, sometimes even when you have that specific vision, you don't necessarily end up at that big vision you were thinking about. For example, at PayPal we distributed t-shirts that said "the new global world currency." Actually, one of the jokes I told Peter is that we do have this new world global currency - what we're trading in is dollars.

另一个问题是，你应该拥有信念还是应该怀有恐惧？本质上，你是应该坚持自己对世界应该如何的愿景而忽略其他一切，一心一意地追求它？还是应该在这些界限之间保持灵活？有时你可能90%偏向一种方式，有时80%偏向另一种方式。你需要对当前问题的状况做出判断。在尝试解决这个问题时，你应该确定我们应该做什么，以及我该如何分配工作。当你思考这些事情时，另一个典型的例子是人们说他们完全由数据驱动——用户在小组讨论中说的话。许多创业方法论强调收集数据并以此为指导。然而，数据只存在于你正在构建的愿景框架内，即你前进方向的假设中。数据甚至可能是负面的，你可能会认为这些负面数据意味着你需要改变或调整对某事的思考方式。但实际上，我对自己正在做的事情保持着特定的愿景。顺便说一句，有时即使你有了那个特定的愿景，你也不一定会最终达到你想象中的那个宏大愿景。例如，在PayPal，我们分发了印有"新的全球世界货币"的T恤。实际上，我告诉彼得的一个笑话是，我们确实有了这个新的全球世界货币——我们交易的是美元。

You may have heard of it, it's existed for a while. We're essentially a master merchant for that. Now, of course this message is about what may be happening with Bitcoin, although that is a whole other topic. However, the key thing is that vision of saying, we're creating a kind of a universal network that allows anyone to pay, anyone to become a merchant. To bring the electronics into the speed of commerce at any business that is being transacted. That vision kept at true north by, we say well, first we think we're going to have a banking model. Then we think we're going to have a debt model. Oh no, we're actually going to have a master merchant model. And how does that actually play out? So you're always combining the vision and the data. And the data's within the framework of a vision. And sometimes, of course, what you learn changes your vision.

你可能听说过它，它已经存在一段时间了。我们本质上是这方面的主要商户。当然，现在这个信息是关于比特币可能发生的情况，尽管那完全是另一个话题。然而，关键是我们所说的愿景，即我们正在创建一种通用网络，允许任何人付款，任何人成为商家。将电子技术带入任何交易业务的商业速度中。这个愿景始终指引着方向，我们首先认为会采用银行模式。然后我们认为会采用债务模式。哦不，我们实际上会采用主要商户模式。这实际上是如何实现的？所以你总是在结合愿景和数据。数据是在愿景的框架内。当然，有时你学到的东西会改变你的愿景。

Now, of course, this message is about how to take intelligent risks. How do I take a focused risk that if I'm right about that one thing, then a bunch of other things break my way? And once I start doing that, I try to figure out how to make my one-shot possibility as high as possible, e.g., how do I minimize other risks? How do I essentially take this risk in an intelligent way that doesn't just go, "Oh yeah, risk. Risk to the wind. Who cares? But let's go." And so this kind of combines that, you know, this image, which I think is the best of the images we found for this yet, is kind of the sense of how to think about it.

当然，这条信息是关于如何承担明智的风险。我如何承担一个有重点的风险，如果我在那一件事上是对的，那么其他很多事情就会顺理成章地解决？一旦我开始这样做，我就会尝试弄清楚如何将我的单次机会可能性最大化，例如，如何最小化其他风险？我如何从根本上以一种明智的方式承担这种风险，而不是仅仅说"哦，是的，风险。随风而去吧。谁在乎呢？但让我们开始吧。"因此，这有点结合了那个，你知道，这张图片，我认为这是我们目前为此找到的最好的图片，它传达了一种思考方式的感觉。

Now, back to what I was saying in terms of having an investment thesis. Part of having an investment thesis is you chart it out - it's kind of a list of bullets. For example, in early LinkedIn, it was like: look, everyone is actually going to be benefited by public professional network. Everyone will realize, including companies, that it's better to have it play out this way. The initial set of adoption will come from essentially people who were like visualize the role, thus were willing to play with it, and then eventually the mass market will come on as they begin to have a network that is already delivering a value proposition to them. That's what kind of an investment thesis can look like, and then you've got economics like initial recruiting and then broadening and other things. You have that investment thesis and you say: is my investment thesis increasing or decreasing in confidence? Do I think that the data I get from the market, when I talk to smart people, how does that change my confidence in it? And this is actually how you essentially minimize risk.

回到我所说的关于投资理论的内容。拥有投资理论的一部分是将其规划出来——就像一系列要点清单。例如，在LinkedIn早期，情况是这样的：看吧，每个人实际上都会从公共职业网络中受益。每个人都会意识到，包括公司在内部，以这种方式发展会更好。最初的采用群体主要来自那些能够想象到这个角色价值的人，因此他们愿意尝试使用，最终大众市场会加入进来，因为他们开始拥有一个已经为他们提供价值主张的网络。这就是投资理论可能呈现的样子，然后你会有诸如初步招聘、随后扩展等其他经济因素。你拥有这个投资理论，然后问自己：我对这个投资理论的信心是在增加还是减少？当我与聪明人交流时，从市场获得的数据如何改变我对它的信心？这实际上就是你如何从根本上最小化风险的方法。

You should always have a long term vision in mind because if you actually completely lose your directions, eventually you'll find yourself in some field there's not a good path out of. But if you're not focused on solving the problem that's immediately in front of you, you're hosed. So part of the question about how you put these things together is you say, okay, short term what's the thing I need to be doing today? Have I made progress today? Have I made progress this week? But is it largely on path?

你始终应该怀有长远愿景，因为如果你真的完全迷失方向，最终你会发现自己陷入某个没有出路的领域。但如果你不专注于解决眼前的问题，你就会陷入困境。因此，如何平衡这些因素的关键在于：短期来看，我今天需要做什么？我今天有进展吗？我这周有进展吗？但这些进展是否基本符合长期方向？

I'll give you an example of how this plays out in terms of financing or in terms of strategy. People frequently think product strategy is fundamental to how start-ups work. Like I have a product idea, that's a thing, I'm a founder. Actually in fact, the next level down on strategy is usually product distribution, whether it's consumer Internet or enterprise or anything else. Because actually in fact no matter how good your product is, if it doesn't get to customers you're hosed. So usually you have to have product distribution as more fundamental than what the product actually is. And the one below it is financing. The reason why it's financing is if you run out of money and the whole effort goes away, even if you have a really good idea it doesn't work.

让我举例说明这在融资或战略层面如何体现。人们常常认为产品战略对初创企业至关重要。比如我有个产品创意，就是这样，我是创始人。但实际上，战略的下一层级通常是产品分发，无论是消费互联网、企业服务还是其他领域。因为事实上无论你的产品多好，如果无法触达客户，你就完蛋了。所以通常你必须把产品分发看得比产品本身更根本。而比产品分发更基础的是融资。之所以是融资，是因为如果你资金耗尽，整个事业就会消失，即使你有非常好的创意也无济于事。

Your directions are important, but I'm thinking about this as a core strategy in terms of execution. Frequently you're thinking about how your product distribution works so that the financing works well, and that's how you architect these things together.

So how do you know if you might be a great founder? Well, you should have some superpowers. Generally speaking, in software, it's useful to be a good product person. It's useful to have good skills in leadership, bringing networks in, and persuading people. And it's useful to be able to recognize whether or not you're on track - this is the most fundamental skill. To have both that kind of belief but also paranoia about whether you're tracking against your investment thesis.

When you do that the right way, and you're learning, and you're assembling people and networks around you, that's generally how you end up being a great founder.

Now, classically - and I deliberately put up five white male pictures - these are the iconic founders. But in fact, founders can be very diverse. They can be extraordinarily talented in different areas because there are different kinds of entrepreneurial companies and different kinds of problems they're trying to solve.

I don't just mean diversity in terms of classic gender, race, etc. I mean diversity in age, diversity in experience. Jack Baugh was a teacher before he got into this. That's the kind of thing that you can and should think about.

你的指导很重要，但我正在将其作为执行层面的核心战略来思考。你经常需要考虑产品分销如何运作才能使融资顺利进行，这就是你如何将这些要素统筹规划的方式。

那么如何判断自己是否可能成为优秀的创始人呢？你应该具备一些超常能力。一般来说，在软件领域，擅长产品管理是很有用的。具备领导力、建立人脉网络和说服他人的能力也很重要。而最关键的是能够识别自己是否走在正确的轨道上——既要保持信念，又要对是否遵循投资理念保持警惕。

当你以正确的方式行事，不断学习，聚集人才和建立人脉网络，这通常就是你最终成为优秀创始人的途径。

传统上——我特意展示了五位白人男性的照片——这些是标志性的创始人形象。但实际上，创始人可以非常多样化。他们可以在不同领域展现出非凡才能，因为存在不同类型的创业公司，他们试图解决的问题也各不相同。

我不仅指传统的性别、种族等方面的多样性，还包括年龄和经验的多样性。杰克·鲍在进入这个领域之前曾是一名教师。这正是你可以并且应该考虑的事情。

The question is how you cross uneven ground. How you assemble networks around you. How you get people to assemble this - it's a constantly changing problem to face when you are trying to found a company. I think that the thing I was trying to get people to think about with this is to say: there's not one skill set. There's an ability to learn and adapt, an ability to constantly have a vision that's driving you, but to be taking input from all sources and then to be creating networks around you. That's essentially what makes a great founder, and your ability to do that while crossing uneven ground in a fog, which is kind of the way that entrepreneurs operate because you don't really know - did you always know this was going to work? No, unless you are crazy. Sometimes crazy works. So with that I will now go to a few questions, but it was kind of this mindset of founders which is kind of key.

问题在于你如何穿越不平坦的地面。如何在你周围建立网络。如何让人们组建这个——当你试图创办一家公司时，这是一个不断变化的问题。我想我试图让人们思考的是：并不存在单一的技能组合。而是要有学习和适应的能力，要有不断拥有驱动你的愿景的能力，但同时要从所有来源获取信息，然后在你周围创建网络。这本质上就是造就伟大创始人的要素，以及你在迷雾中穿越不平坦地面时做到这一点的能力，这有点像企业家的运作方式，因为你并不真正知道——你一直都知道这会成功吗？不知道，除非你疯了。有时候疯狂确实有效。那么，我现在将回答几个问题，但这正是创始人的思维方式，这很关键。

And if there's no questions, oh, here. And so people were doing clean tech and enterprise software and everything else. It's a much harder problem now, because everyone thinks the Internet and mobile is interesting. And so breaking through the noise is really key. So the strategy we use wouldn't work. We just set up, sent out some invitations to a group of people and then tuned the mechanism to have, and did PR to get people. Like one of the decisions we made early that was right was to say should we only allow it as invite only? Or should we allow cold sign ups? The reason we should allow cold sign ups is because the people who are super enthusiastic about this weren't necessarily the people you know, so they would sign up and spread it. That sort of thing were all the kind of decisions we made. Now that challenge is much harder because the challenge when you think about product distribution is, it's how are you competing for potential customers' or potential members time and what do they think, what do they have to believe in. Back in 2003 it was like well, a professional network. That's potentially a good idea, what the hell. I'll play with that. There's not a lot of other things for me to look at. Today, there's tons of things and so your strategy today, when you're looking at product distribution, has to be, what is my really decisive edge? What is the hack that I know that other people don't know?

如果没有问题的话，哦，这里。当时人们都在做清洁技术、企业软件和其他各种东西。现在这个问题要困难得多，因为每个人都认为互联网和移动技术很有趣。因此突破噪音干扰确实很关键。我们使用的策略现在不会奏效。我们只是建立起来，向一群人发出邀请，然后调整机制，并通过公关来吸引人们。我们早期做的一个正确决定是：我们应该只允许邀请注册吗？还是应该允许直接注册？我们应该允许直接注册的原因是，那些对此非常热情的人不一定是你认识的人，所以他们会注册并传播它。这类事情都是我们当时做的各种决定。现在这个挑战要困难得多，因为当你考虑产品分发时，挑战在于你如何争夺潜在客户或潜在成员的时间，他们在想什么，他们需要相信什么。回到2003年，就像是：嗯，一个专业网络。这可能是个好主意，管他呢。我会试试看。当时没有太多其他东西可以关注。今天，有无数东西，所以你今天的策略，当你在考虑产品分发时，必须是：我真正的决定性优势是什么？我知道而别人不知道的技巧是什么？

When someone comes to you, how do you say no? 100% of the time in this case, I only meet with someone when they come to me through a reference. So one of the things, by the way, is that I have to run off after this because I have a meeting I need to get to. If you want to actually get time and attention, find a reference. It's not a pitch to using LinkedIn, it's a question of how you sort out time. You can find out, like Sam knows me. Lift up, throw Sam under the bus. Right? Yes. A reference to me is in fact the way that I do this. For example, when I met with the AirBnB guys, part of the reason why I could interrupt them two minutes into their pitch and say I'm going to make you an offer to invest was because I'd already had references on them. I want to hear the rest of the pitch because I think what you're doing here is magical and awesome. That was only two minutes, not even thirty minutes, because I already knew about them before coming in. By and large, that's some version of what is true of most of the great industries. It's that network that's really key.

当有人来找你时，你如何拒绝？在这种情况下，我总是只通过推荐与人会面。顺便说一句，其中一件事是，之后我必须赶紧离开，因为我有个会议要参加。如果你真想获得时间和关注，就找个推荐人。这不是在推销使用领英，而是关于你如何安排时间的问题。你可以找到，比如萨姆认识我。把萨姆推出来当替罪羊。对吗？是的。对我来说，推荐实际上就是我做事的方式。例如，当我见到AirBnB团队时，我能在他们演讲两分钟时打断他们，并表示要给他们投资报价，部分原因是我已经获得了他们的推荐信息。我想听剩下的演讲，因为我认为你们在做的事情非常神奇和了不起。那仅仅两分钟，甚至不到三十分钟，因为我在来之前就已经了解他们了。总的来说，这在大多数优秀行业中都存在某种程度的真实性。真正关键的是那个网络。

I think there was a question over here too. The ability to say coherently what you're targeting and to articulate something that isn't trying to boil the ocean or a Swiss army knife approach, but is like one focus - if we're right about this then it works - that is actually pretty important to being able to judge a founder. Because if you don't have that level of clarity, you're not going to be able to assemble the network behind you. You're not going to be able to get investors, you're not going to get employees. You have to be able to articulate a very clear mission about what you're doing. And insight is helpful, although a little bit of this depends on the stage. I find myself attracted to founders who've analyzed the problem in a good way, but frequently I've seen great founders who do not present good analysis but have an instinct about what they're doing, and so you more chart what's going on around them.

我想这边也有一个问题。能够连贯地说明你的目标，并阐述一些不是试图面面俱到或采用万能方法的内容，而是专注于一点——如果我们对此判断正确，那么它就会奏效——这对于评估创始人实际上非常重要。因为如果你没有那种清晰度，你将无法聚集支持你的网络。你将无法获得投资者，你将无法获得员工。你必须能够清晰地阐述你正在做的事情的使命。洞察力是有帮助的，尽管这在某种程度上取决于阶段。我发现自己被那些以良好方式分析问题的创始人所吸引，但我经常看到那些没有提供良好分析但对所做的事情有直觉的优秀创始人，因此你更多地描绘他们周围正在发生的事情。

When Lincoln had like five years of action, I guess the right economic system design for every individual's life and for organization's life is to have public professional profiles. That world is the way the world should be. Everyone is much better off with it. And we are getting closer to that than everyone else. It may be that it hasn't taken off as fast as I'd like, it may be that the general world is going, oh this social stuff is really interesting. We don't. Like, we could only get in the news in the Fall and the Summer of 2003 by saying we were Friendster but for business, which is completely nonsensical once you begin to look at the thing. But it was like okay we'll cover you cause it's friends but for business. And that was important to begin to get people to pay attention to us. And so the confidence was that world I still have confidence believe that it should exist and no-one is getting closer to it than we. It's taking us maybe longer than I'd hoped to get there but that's okay.

当林肯大约有五年的实际行动经验时，我认为正确的经济体系设计应该为每个人的生活和组织的生活建立公开的专业档案。那样的世界才是世界应有的样子。每个人都会因此过得更好。而且我们比任何人都更接近那个目标。可能它没有像我期望的那样快速发展，可能整个世界都在说，哦这些社交的东西真的很有趣。但我们不这么认为。比如，在2003年秋季和夏季，我们只能通过声称自己是"商务版Friendster"来获得新闻报道，但当你真正审视这件事时，这完全是荒谬的。但当时的情况是，好吧，我们会报道你，因为这是商务版的朋友圈。这对开始吸引人们关注我们很重要。所以我仍然坚信那个世界应该存在，而且没有人比我们更接近它。到达那里可能比我期望的要花更长时间，但这没关系。

One of the tests that I frequently use in interaction is I push on the idea some, and what I'm looking for is both flexibility and persistence. I have conviction in what I'm thinking and I'm arguing it, but I'm listening to what you're saying and I'm adapting to the concerns and whatnot of how you think about that. Sometimes you'll find someone who says, look, I've learned to mimic that behavior, so I've learned to say for example I've learned to look like I'm reasoning with you and I look like I'm thinking about the challenge you're bringing up but actually in fact I'm ignoring you. Ignoring me that might be fine. Ignoring the world in general is usually a disaster. And so those are the kind of things that in the measurement you can see essentially getting wrong. But usually, most often, the kind of reference questions I asked about founders is like adaptability. One of the phrases that I frequently look for is infinite learning curve. Because each entrepreneurial pattern is, to some degree, unique and new, and can you learn the new one? Is a way of doing it. And so like, does the learning break down, or is there some major skill-set? Is there an ego issue that gets in the way? Like, well, I must be the one everyone must adulate me, and that will cause you to behave wrongly in adapting to the problem. I think I have one last question.

我在互动中经常使用的一个测试是稍微推动某个想法，我寻找的是灵活性和坚持性两者兼备。我对自己思考的内容有信念并为之辩护，但同时我也在倾听你所说的内容，并适应你思考问题的方式和关切。有时你会发现有人说，看，我学会了模仿那种行为，比如我学会了看起来像是在与你讲道理，看起来像是在思考你提出的挑战，但实际上我是在忽略你。忽略我可能没问题。但完全忽略世界通常是一场灾难。这些就是在评估中你能看到本质上出错的地方。但通常，我询问创始人的参考问题大多是关于适应性的。我经常寻找的一个短语是"无限学习曲线"。因为每个创业模式在某种程度上都是独特和全新的，你能学会新的模式吗？这是一种做事方式。那么，学习是否会中断，或者是否存在某些主要技能缺陷？是否存在阻碍的自我问题？比如，我必须成为那个所有人都必须崇拜的人，这会导致你在适应问题时行为不当。我想我还有最后一个问题。

So, what makes a good partnership when you're evaluating how to be a great co-founder? Co-founding team, how to evaluate, and then how to think about co-founders. So the first thing is, it's super important that you collaborate really well. Because, if you in fact, don't have pretty good serious trust, it's problematic. So, okay, let me give a little bit longer answer to this, then. So the key thing is when you're thinking about founders, do you have a diversity of the necessary strengths across the whole range of strengths that would be useful? Frequently you need one technical founder. At least frequently, you need to have someone who is going to be dedicated to the business side, fundraising, these sorts of things. That's kind of classically skill set when you think about the two to three. And usually, it's kind of some composition across them. For example, one of the things that people will classically tell you is like for example don't invest in a husband and wife team. And actually, that adds a little extra freight to it and everything else cause there's personal dynamics also.

那么，在评估如何成为优秀联合创始人时，什么才是良好的合作伙伴关系？关于联合创始团队，如何评估以及如何看待联合创始人。首先，你们能否良好协作至关重要。因为如果实际上缺乏足够的深度信任，就会产生问题。那么，让我就此给出更详细的回答。关键点在于，当你考虑创始人时，是否具备涵盖所有有用能力的必要优势多样性？通常你需要一位技术型创始人。至少经常需要有人专门负责业务方面、融资等事务。这是典型的技能组合配置，当你考虑两到三人团队时。通常这涉及到某种跨领域的能力组合。例如，人们通常会告诫你不要投资夫妻档团队。实际上，这会增加额外的负担，因为其中还涉及个人关系动态。

So, what's going wrong or when you think the team is upset? I actually think that what you're looking for is: do they collaborate well, do they help each other get to truth. Okay, so for example, I'm most heartened when I'm talking to a team that when they're reasoning to each other, they're not like "oh, we're just all singing from the same thing." It's like "oh, well did you think of this or what about this is a challenge." Like you're navigating the field of battle which has a bunch of risks. Like for example, one of the things that was pretty common in PayPal is Max who invented the prod systems and everything else would frequently come into Peter's office, Peter Thiel, mass legend and say, "look here is some things that are going to kill us and let me focus you on them." Right so, it's not like we're all just kind of saying, "oh yes, we're all sitting here." We are adjusting to what is truth and what's the problem we need to solve, what's the problem in the short term, what's the problem in the long term and how are we tackling it? And that composition within the team, that collective problem solving, that collective learning is the kind of thing that actually usually makes great teams.

那么，当团队出现问题或你认为团队感到沮丧时，实际上我认为你要寻找的是：他们是否良好协作，是否互相帮助以寻求真相。例如，当我与一个团队交谈时，最让我感到鼓舞的是，当他们互相推理时，他们不会说"哦，我们都在唱同一个调子"，而是会说"哦，你考虑过这个吗？或者这个方面有什么挑战？"就像你在战场上航行，那里充满各种风险。例如，在PayPal很常见的一件事是，发明了生产系统和其他一切的马克斯经常走进彼得·蒂尔的办公室，这位传奇人物，然后说："看，这里有一些会毁掉我们的事情，让我帮你关注这些问题。"所以，这不像我们都在说："哦，是的，我们都坐在这里。"我们正在调整以适应什么是真相，我们需要解决什么问题，短期问题是什么，长期问题是什么，以及我们如何解决它？团队内部的这种构成，那种集体问题解决，那种集体学习，正是通常造就伟大团队的因素。

Yeah, thank you for this wonderful lecture. So different founders, different areas, how do you identify them? The talk was aimed at what is unique about the mindset of founders. That is a great founder across all founders. That's part of what this was. An attempt to say look because there are differences. For example in software, speed to market, speed to learning is really key. In hardware, if you mess it up, you're dead. So accuracy really matters. If you build and ship the wrong thing, you're hosed. Generally speaking, as an investor, and this is part of the reason why a lot of investors have a certain set of things that they then learn pretty well and try to reapply because they try to understand a domain well enough to be able to identify which of the founders in this domain really matter. And if we're investing in this domain, how do we do that well? So there are attributes that are unique per domain. For example, one of the classic ones is how good must you be at operational efficiencies in terms of margins, cost controls, etcetera. If you're dealing in the worlds of atoms including even in commerce, you've gotta be really good at that. If you're doing a digital game like a Zinga-like startup, it doesn't matter at all. So you look for that kind of fix and proclivities. Part of the beginning of this is, it's not a fact that one person is good at everything. I would say one of the funniest conversations I had was with a guy, a friend of mine who worked for me at my first start-up's social network.

是的，感谢这场精彩的讲座。那么不同的创始人、不同的领域，您如何识别他们？这次讲座旨在探讨创始人思维方式的独特之处。在所有创始人中，什么造就了伟大的创始人。这正是本次讲座的部分目的。试图说明因为存在差异。例如在软件领域，上市速度、学习速度确实至关重要。在硬件领域，如果搞砸了，你就完蛋了。因此准确性确实很重要。如果你构建并发布了错误的产品，你就会陷入困境。总的来说，作为投资者，这也是为什么很多投资者会掌握一套特定技能并试图重复应用的原因，因为他们试图充分理解一个领域以便能够识别该领域中真正重要的创始人。如果我们要投资这个领域，我们如何做好这一点？因此每个领域都有其独特的属性。例如，其中一个经典问题是：在运营效率方面，包括利润率、成本控制等，你需要达到多高的水平。如果你从事实体世界，甚至包括商业领域，你必须在这方面非常出色。如果你开发的是数字游戏，像Zynga那样的初创公司，这就完全不重要了。所以你会寻找那种特定的能力和倾向。这其中的部分前提是，一个人不可能擅长所有事情。我想说，我经历过最有趣的对话之一是与一位在我第一家社交网络初创公司为我工作的朋友进行的。

I would be, like, one of the funniest conversations I had with a guy, a friend of mine who worked for me at my first start-up's social net. He looked at me and he said, "Reed, I would never hire you to be a manager of McDonald's." I'm like yeah, I wouldn't either. I'd be terrible at that. Right, and so it's the skill set that fits, but also the whole point of this is actually being navigating a set of things that look like paradoxes. Sometimes being heavy on one, sometimes heavy on the other. And being, having the right judgement at the moment in terms of what you're doing. And that's what tends to be more universal.

这就像是我和一个朋友有过的最有趣的对话之一，他在我第一家初创公司的社交网络为我工作。他看着我说："里德，我永远不会雇你当麦当劳的经理。"我说是啊，我也不会。我在这方面会很糟糕。所以，这不仅是适合的技能组合，而且关键在于实际上要驾驭一系列看似矛盾的事情。有时侧重这一方面，有时侧重另一方面。并且根据你正在做的事情，在当下做出正确的判断。这往往是更普遍适用的。

You mentioned that you're taking longer then you'd like to see growing and speak a little bit about when, how do you know whether or not you should say and how do you know when to give up on also maybe with respect to like your personalize life and career goals. How it fits in? So the question is basically how do you know when to pivot?

你提到你花了比预期更长的时间才看到增长，请谈谈你如何知道是否应该坚持，以及如何知道何时应该放弃，也许还包括你的个人生活和职业目标。这如何协调？所以问题基本上是你如何知道何时应该转向？

Part of the reason why having investment thesis and your confidence in your investment thesis and being pretty clear on that is, generally speaking, the answer that I give people is if you're confidence is unmeasured for a fairly long time or is decreasing, cause unmeasured for a fairly long time should be decreasing and it's decreasing. And then you go into intense mode where you're trying to figure out what kinds of things you would do that would increase your confidence. Right, and that's failing. That's a seriously good time to think about pivoting Right.

拥有投资理念、对你的投资理念有信心并且对此非常清楚的部分原因是，一般来说，我给人们的答案是，如果你的信心在相当长一段时间内无法衡量或正在下降，因为相当长时间无法衡量应该意味着下降，而且它确实在下降。然后你进入紧张模式，试图找出哪些事情可以增加你的信心。如果这失败了，那就是考虑转向的好时机。

And you might have thesis on can we raise money. You might have thesis on will, what's the pattern by which the product distribution and growth or, you know, viral limitation or SEO or anything else will work. And just like, well, I tried these things and this fourth thing doesn't seem as good as these three and the next two things that I

你可能有一个关于能否筹集资金的理论。你可能有一个关于产品分发和增长模式的理论，或者病毒式传播限制、SEO或其他任何东西是否有效的理论。就像，我尝试了这些事情，这第四件事似乎不如前三件好，而我接下来的两件事

the next two things that I

So even worse, that begins to decrease your confidence and that's when you should think about pivoting. A frequent mistake when it comes to pivoting is waiting until you've essentially been crashed into the wall and everything is dead and you can't maneuver anymore. That means you waited way too long.

更糟糕的是，这会开始削弱你的信心，而这正是你应该考虑转型的时候。关于转型的一个常见错误是等到你基本上已经撞墙、一切都完蛋、无法再采取任何行动时才行动。这意味着你等待得太久了。

Think about others don't necessarily see. Overall, how efficient do you think the startup ecosystem is at identifying good opportunities? So how good is the startup ecosystem at identifying contrarian opportunities? Let's see. That's kind of challenge, because the moment it actually becomes in vogue, it's less contrarian. I'd say it's mixed. Sometimes, because part of what makes a great investor is an ability to take this radical shot, and there's usually someone if you can find your way to them through the network. Sometimes difficult, tons of noise, hard to get to the signal. On the other hand, there's sometimes things that are just totally crazy. Like one of the funniest things is Benchmark was the only one that would fund eBay. If you talk to most of the people in the Valley a year or 18 months ago about Bitcoin, they would've told you "Bit what?" They had no idea what it is. By the way, it's still unclear how Bitcoin will play out, although I think the fact that there will be a distributed trust system on cryptocurrency is almost certainly going to exist in the world. The real question is: is Bitcoin the first or last cryptocurrency? First, because there's new ones and new features. Last, because it's the one that has network effects and is already going. I think it's pretty good with it. Frequently what happens is people think they're contrarian because they're doing something they believe in.

思考他人未必能察觉的事物。总体而言，你认为初创企业生态系统在识别优质机会方面的效率如何？那么初创企业生态系统在识别逆向投资机会方面表现如何？让我们看看。这颇具挑战性，因为当某种趋势真正流行起来时，它就不再是逆向投资了。我认为情况好坏参半。有时，因为优秀投资者的特质之一就是能够采取这种激进的投资策略，而且通常只要你能够通过人脉网络找到合适的对象，总会有人支持你。有时困难重重，噪音太多，难以捕捉有效信号。另一方面，有时会出现一些完全疯狂的想法。比如最有趣的事情之一是，Benchmark是唯一愿意资助eBay的机构。如果你在一年或18个月前与硅谷的大多数人谈论比特币，他们会反问"比特什么？"他们根本不知道这是什么。顺便说一句，比特币最终将如何发展仍不明朗，尽管我认为基于加密货币的分布式信任系统几乎肯定会在世界上存在。真正的问题是：比特币是第一个还是最后一个加密货币？说它是第一个，因为有新的加密货币和功能不断出现。说它是最后一个，因为它已经具备网络效应并且正在运行。我认为在这方面表现相当不错。经常发生的情况是，人们认为自己是在逆向投资，因为他们正在做自己坚信的事情。

I'll give you two examples. I get about 30 pictures sent to me a day that I don't basically look at unless something in the title makes me laugh, in which case I look at it mostly as comedy. One of them was wearable diapers, which was the computer monitoring whether or not the kid is taking a pee or a poop and it lets you know. If you're that far away from your child in this kind of thing, it's probably a bad sign of other things. And then the other one was a customized e-commerce bongs. Like, yes you do have a contrarian idea, but not the right way. So I think generally speaking, the system's pretty good at it.

我给你们举两个例子。我每天会收到大约30张图片，基本上不会看，除非标题有些内容让我发笑，这种情况下我大多把它当作喜剧来看。其中一个是可穿戴尿布，就是通过电脑监测孩子是否在排尿或排便，然后通知你。如果你在这种事情上离孩子那么远，可能预示着其他方面的问题。另一个是定制电商烟枪。是的，你确实有一个逆向思维的想法，但方向不对。所以总的来说，我认为这个系统在这方面相当不错。

Think about what others don't necessarily see. It is a unique concept that is actually sometimes, frequently a good bet. However, it can sometimes completely flame out. One of the things you're doing when you're testing your investment thesis is determining what would lead you to think whether there was a market there or not. Because at the beginning, there are no markets. And so it is of course conceptually possible to create markets. People think that there's a new need for this sort of thing. On the other hand, the problem is how do you get fast adoption if people don't even know that they want it as a category. So they say, well, but people just realize - a classic entrepreneurial misfire. A classic one is if people just realize once it exists they'll realize they really love it and they'll line up in droves for it. Well, there are a few entrepreneurs, Steve Jobs one of them, who can do that. Most of the time it doesn't work out that way, and so you have to say in your investment thesis why it is that you think when you're thinking about a market that isn't already existent, that you know that other people don't know on the contrarian basis that leads you to think that market should exist. For example, a micro one with LinkedIn was that the classifieds means of recruiting was in fact an exercise of newspapers, an exercise in information age. And actually, recruiting direct to people is part of what the networked age, and the internet, and that's actually how recruiting should go. Now, it was relatively easy to

思考那些别人未必能看到的东西。这是一个独特的概念，实际上有时，经常是一个不错的赌注。然而，它有时也可能完全失败。当你测试投资论点时，其中一项工作就是确定什么会让你认为那里是否存在市场。因为在最初阶段，市场并不存在。因此，从概念上讲创造市场当然是可能的。人们认为这类事物存在新的需求。另一方面，问题是如果人们甚至不知道自己需要这个类别，你如何获得快速采用。所以他们说，但是人们只是意识到——一个典型的企业家误判。一个典型的例子是，如果人们一旦意识到它的存在，就会意识到自己真的很喜欢它，并且会成群结队地排队购买。确实有少数企业家，史蒂夫·乔布斯就是其中之一，能够做到这一点。但大多数情况下并不会这样发展，所以你必须在投资论点中说明，当你思考一个尚不存在的市场时，为什么你认为基于逆向思维你知道而别人不知道的东西会让你认为这个市场应该存在。例如，LinkedIn的一个微观例子是，分类招聘实际上是报纸时代的产物，是信息时代的实践。而实际上，直接面向个人的招聘是网络时代和互联网的一部分，这实际上才是招聘应有的方式。现在，这相对容易

Now, it was relatively easy to

Validate that, but you know, that's the kind of thing where you think about, there's potentially a new market. Last question, boss. Yeah, last question. When do you know you've known someone long enough to start a company with? One of the things Stan told us in the first semester was you need to know someone for a while when you guys started PayPal. For example, how long did you? It was a large group of people, so how do you know okay, I trust the people enough to start a company. So I'm repeating the question in part because we're recorded and everything else, and I want to make sure the people hear it. But the question basically is how do you know that you trust someone well enough to be a cofounder. There's a whole bunch of different variables that go into it and, look, it's one of the risks that you take. And you kind of get to a thesis of do I think that I know them well enough? Now I'll parallel one thing that I think there's a parallel here that I think is super useful. So one of the things I tell my portfolio company CEOs or founders when they're thinking about hiring a CEO is I think that the only way to do this is, when you get down to the people that you're thinking you may hire as a CEO, you spend 20 plus hours with them. Right, where you go into as much depth in a conversation about anything you think is a possible difference of opinion, belief, work style. So you've identified all this up front so that it's not that you have a contract, it's not like signing a contract, this is how we do it. But we've established the conversation. We've gone all the parameters.

验证这一点，但你知道，这正是那种你会思考的事情，可能存在一个新的市场。最后一个问题，老板。是的，最后一个问题。你如何知道与某人相识足够久，可以一起创办公司？斯坦在第一学期告诉我们的一件事是，当你们创办PayPal时，你需要认识某人一段时间。比如说，你们认识了多久？那是一大群人，那么你怎么确定自己足够信任这些人来创办公司。我重复这个问题部分是因为我们在录音，我想确保大家都能听清楚。但问题基本上是你如何知道自己足够信任某人，让他成为联合创始人。这其中涉及很多不同的变量，而且，这是你需要承担的风险之一。你会形成一个论点：我认为我是否足够了解他们？现在我要类比一件事，我认为这里有一个非常有用的类比。当我投资组合公司的CEO或创始人在考虑聘请CEO时，我告诉他们的一件事是，我认为唯一的方法是，当你确定可能聘请某人担任CEO时，你要花20多个小时与他们相处。深入讨论任何你认为可能存在分歧的观点、信念、工作方式。这样你就能提前识别所有这些问题，这不是说你有一份合同，不像签署合同那样规定我们该怎么做。但我们已经建立了对话。我们已经讨论了所有参数。

You or someone you know may have had a conversation about what we might agree with or disagree with. One of the things that I frequently think is worth covering is almost like the divorce. Why would we want to divorce? What would lead me to say this isn't working, right? And to cover that up front as part of it. Because then, at that point, when you get into the field of battle, which is hugely stressful, you go through this valley shadow of the moment. You've at least got the basis of we already conversed about a wide variety of things. We've set up essentially some expectations about how we might be planning together, and if it begins to vary off that, it's relatively easy to bring it up in a way that you're problem solving. And that's the kind of thing that I think you frequently should be fairly confident that you have that level of trust. For me, frequently, it's to have a set of robust conversations. Such that, if something comes up later, it's like, well, we talked about this inversion. And we can bring that up.

你或你认识的人可能已经讨论过我们可能同意或不同意什么。我经常认为值得讨论的事情之一几乎就像是离婚。我们为什么要离婚？什么会让我说这行不通，对吧？并且要将其作为一部分提前说明。因为那时，当你进入战场时，压力巨大，你会经历这个关键时刻的阴影。你至少已经有了我们之前讨论过各种事情的基础。我们基本上已经建立了一些关于如何共同规划的期望，如果开始偏离这一点，相对容易以解决问题的方式提出来。我认为你应该经常对自己拥有这种程度的信任相当有信心。对我来说，经常是要进行一系列强有力的对话。这样，如果以后出现问题，就像，嗯，我们讨论过这种反转。我们可以提出来。
