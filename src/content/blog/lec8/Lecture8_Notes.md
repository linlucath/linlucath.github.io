Thanks for having me, Sam. I'm Stanley, the founder of DoorDash. It's really amazing to be here because it wasn't actually that long ago when I sat in your seats. I was class of 2014, graduated in CS, as well as my co-founder, Andy. For those of you who don't know what DoorDash is, we're building an on-demand delivery network for local cities.

谢谢邀请我，Sam。我是 Stanley，DoorDash 的创始人。能站在这里真的很不可思议，因为不久前我还坐在你们的位置上。我是 2014 届毕业生，主修计算机科学，我的联合创始人 Andy 也是。对于不了解 DoorDash 的人，我们正在为本地城市建立一个按需配送网络。

I want to start off with this photo that I took just a few months ago. I think this was the night when we just raised our series A. I took this photo as I was walking back to where I lived. I actually lived in Roble at the time, on campus. I took this photo because I realized just how ridiculous the combinations of things I was holding in my hand at that time.

我想从这张几个月前拍摄的照片开始讲起。我想这应该是我们刚完成 A 轮融资的那天晚上。我在走回住所的路上拍了这张照片。当时我实际上住在校园里的 Roble 宿舍。我拍下这张照片是因为我意识到当时手里拿的东西组合有多么荒谬。

I was holding my CS 247 homework, my tax forms since it was April and I had to fill out taxes, that yellow speeding ticket, and right below that was a $15 million dollar piece of paper I just signed from Sequoia. That kind of summarizes just how ridiculous our journey has been, starting at Stanford.

我拿着 CS 247 的作业，四月份需要填写的税表，那张黄色的超速罚单，而在这些下面是我刚刚与红杉资本签署的 1500 万美元文件。这某种程度上概括了我们在斯坦福开始的这段旅程有多么不可思议。

Doing this while I was at Stanford, and then transitioning this into an actual startup, I want to share that story with you today. It all began two years ago, actually, in a macaron store. It was my junior year at Stanford. This was fall quarter, and at that time, I was really passionate about how do you build technology for small business owners?

在斯坦福期间从事这个项目，然后将其转变为一个真正的初创公司，今天我想与大家分享这个故事。一切始于两年前，实际上是在一家马卡龙店里。那是我在斯坦福的大三学年，秋季学期。当时，我对如何为小企业主构建技术充满热情。

I sat down with Chloe, the owner of Chantal Guillon, a macaron store in Palo Alto at that time.

我与 Chloe 进行了交谈，她是当时帕洛阿尔托 Chantal Guillon 马卡龙店的店主。

Just interviewing her, trying to get feedback on this product prototype we'd been working on, and also just learning about what her problems were in general. It was during this meeting when Chloe first brought up this problem of delivery. I remember she took out this really, really thick booklet and showed me pages and pages of delivery orders. A lot of these orders she had to turn down because there's no way she could have fulfilled them, as she had no drivers and she was the one who ended up having to personally deliver all these orders. That was a very interesting moment for us. Over the course of the next few weeks, we talked to around another 150-200 small business owners. When we brought up this idea of delivery, they kept agreeing with us, saying this is a really big problem for them. They don't have a delivery infrastructure, it's such a huge pain for them, and there aren't any good solutions out there. This led us to wonder why delivery, being such a common and obvious thing, hasn't been solved before. We thought maybe because people have tried this in the past but failed because there wasn't consumer demand for this. So we thought about how we could test this hypothesis.

当时只是在采访她，试图获取对我们正在开发的产品原型的反馈，同时也想了解她面临的一般性问题。就在这次会议期间，克洛伊首次提出了配送这个问题。我记得她拿出了一本非常非常厚的册子，给我看了很多页的配送订单。很多订单她不得不拒绝，因为她根本无法完成这些订单，她没有司机，最终只能亲自配送所有这些订单。这对我们来说是一个非常有趣的时刻。在接下来的几周里，我们又与大约 150-200 名小企业主进行了交谈。当我们提到配送这个想法时，他们不断表示赞同，说这对他们来说确实是个大问题。他们没有配送基础设施，这对他们来说非常痛苦，而且市面上没有任何好的解决方案。这让我们不禁思考，配送如此普遍和显而易见，为什么之前没有人解决这个问题。我们认为可能是因为过去有人尝试过，但由于缺乏消费者需求而失败了。于是我们开始思考如何验证这个假设。

We were just a bunch of college kids at that time. You know, we didn't own trucks or delivery infrastructures, or anything like that, right. We can't just spin up a delivery company overnight. So, how can we test this assumption we had? So we decided to create a simple experiment with restaurant delivery. We spent about an afternoon just putting together a really quick landing page. And, when I went on the internet, I found some PDF menus of restaurants in Palo Alto, stuck it up there and then had a phone number at the bottom, which was our personal phone number, actually. And that was it, we put up the landing page, we called it PaloAltoDelivery.com. And this is actually what it looked like. You know, super, super simple, ugly, like honestly, we weren't really expecting anything. We just launched it. And all we wanted to see was, would we get phone calls from this? And if we got enough phone calls, then maybe this delivery idea was something worth pursuing. So we put it up there, we weren't really expecting anything, and we were driving back home. And all of a sudden we got a phone call, you know? Someone called, they wanted to order Thai food. And we're like, oh wow, this is a real order. Like, you know, we have to do something about it, right? So, so we were in our cars, and we're, like, okay, like, we're not doing anything right now. Might as well just, let's just swing by Siam Royal, pick up some Pad Thai and let's just deliver it to this person.

那时我们还只是一群大学生。你知道，我们没有卡车或配送基础设施，也没有任何类似的东西。我们不可能一夜之间就创办一家配送公司。那么，我们该如何验证我们的假设呢？于是我们决定做一个简单的餐厅配送实验。我们花了大约一个下午的时间，快速制作了一个着陆页面。当我在网上查找时，我找到了一些帕洛阿尔托餐厅的 PDF 菜单，把它们放上去，然后在底部留了一个电话号码——实际上那是我们的个人电话号码。就这样，我们建立了这个着陆页面，称之为 PaloAltoDelivery.com。这就是它当时的样子。说实话，超级简单、丑陋，我们真的没抱什么期望。我们只是发布了它。我们想看的只是，会不会有人打电话来？如果我们接到足够多的电话，那么这个配送想法或许就值得继续推进。于是我们发布了页面，并没有真正期待什么，然后开车回家。突然，我们接到了一个电话，你知道吗？有人打电话来想订泰国菜。我们当时想，哇，这是个真实的订单。你知道，我们必须做点什么，对吧？所以，当时我们在车里，想着，好吧，反正我们现在也没什么事。不如顺路去 Siam Royal 餐厅，买些泰式炒河粉，然后给这个人送过去。

let's just deliver it to this person, and let's try to learn how this whole delivery thing works. And we did. We delivered to this guy up in Alpine Road. I remember, he told us, I was asking, oh, how did you hear about us? What do you do? And he told us he was a scholar. And then he handed me his business card, and it said he was the author of a book called Weed the People. And that was like our first ever delivery, right? It was like the best delivery, first delivery/worst delivery you could have asked for. You couldn't make this stuff up.

我们就把它送给这个人吧，顺便了解下整个配送流程是怎么运作的。我们真的这么做了。我们把货送到了阿尔派恩路的那位客户那里。我记得他告诉我们，我当时还问他，你是怎么知道我们的？你是做什么的？他说自己是位学者。然后他递给我名片，上面写着他是《Weed the People》这本书的作者。这算是我们的第一次配送吧？简直堪称最完美又最糟糕的首次配送体验。这种经历编都编不出来。

And, again, in the next day, we got, you know, two more phone calls. But yet, the day after that, we got five, and then it became seven, and then it became ten. And then, soon, we started gaining traction on campus with paloaltodelivery.com which was pretty crazy. Because think about it, right, this was a landing page. You have to look up PDF menus to place your order, and they have to call in. This isn't exactly the most professional looking site, yet people were still, we kept getting phone calls. We kept getting orders.

结果第二天我们又接到了两个电话。但紧接着第三天，我们收到了五个订单，然后是七个，后来变成了十个。很快，我们的 paloaltodelivery.com 网站在校园里开始受到关注，这简直太疯狂了。想想看，这只是一个着陆页面。你得查阅 PDF 菜单才能下单，还得打电话进来。这网站看起来并不专业，但人们依然持续来电，订单源源不断。

And, that's kind of we knew we were on to something, when people were willing. All right. We knew we found a need people wanted, when people are willing to put up with all this. So I think another key point to remember is we launched this in about an hour, right. Like we didn't spend, you know. We didn't have any drivers. We didn't have any algorithms. We didn't spend, you know. We didn't have a back-end. We didn't spend 6 months building like a fancy

当客户愿意忍受这些不便时，我们就知道这事有戏。没错。当人们愿意忍受所有这些麻烦时，我们就知道找到了市场需求。所以我认为另一个关键点是，我们只用了一个小时就上线了这个服务。我们没花什么成本，没有配送员，没有算法，没有后台系统，也没有花六个月去打造什么华丽的

We didn't spend 6 months building a fancy dispatch system. We didn't have any of that. We just launched. Because at the beginning, none of that is necessary, right? At the beginning, it's all about testing your idea, trying to get this thing off the ground, and figuring out whether this was something people even wanted. And it's okay to hack things together at the beginning. At YC there's a mantra we like to talk about: doing things that don't scale. So at the beginning we were the delivery drivers. We would go to class and then after class we'd deliver food. We were the customer support. I sometimes had to take phone calls during lecture. We spent afternoons going down University Avenue passing out flyers to promote DoorDash. We didn't have any dispatch systems, so we used Square to charge all of our customers, used Google Docs to keep track of our orders, and used Apple's Find My Friends to keep track of where all of our drivers were. Just figuring out what works, hacking together solutions, trying to get this thing off the ground. In fact, at one point we were growing so fast that Square actually shut our account down because we were under suspicions for money laundering. Think about it: we were getting small chunks of $15, $20 orders coming in at a rapid pace. Luckily, my co-founder Tony worked at Square, so he just emailed some buddies there.

我们并没有花六个月时间构建复杂的调度系统。我们没有任何这些东西。我们直接上线了。因为在最初阶段，这些都不是必需的，对吧？最初阶段的关键是测试你的想法，努力让项目启动起来，并弄清楚这是否是人们真正需要的东西。在开始时拼凑解决方案是可以接受的。在 YC 有一条我们常说的格言：做那些无法规模化的事情。所以在初期，我们自己就是配送司机。我们会去上课，然后课后去送餐。我们自己就是客服。我有时不得不在上课时接听电话。我们花了很多个下午在大学大道上分发传单来推广 DoorDash。我们没有任何调度系统，所以我们用 Square 向所有客户收费，用 Google Docs 跟踪订单，用苹果的"查找我的朋友"来追踪所有司机的位置。就是摸索有效的方法，拼凑解决方案，努力让项目启动起来。事实上，有段时间我们增长太快，Square 甚至关闭了我们的账户，因为我们被怀疑洗钱。想想看：我们不断收到 15 美元、20 美元的小额订单，而且速度很快。幸运的是，我的联合创始人 Tony 在 Square 工作，所以他直接给那里的几个朋友发了邮件。

So he just e-mailed some buddies there and everything was solved. Yeah, and another thing about doing things that don't scale is that it also allows you to become an expert in your business. Right? Like driving helps us understand how the delivery process worked, you know. We used that as an opportunity to talk to customers, talk to our restaurants. We did dispatching which helped us figure out how we manually dispatched every driver. And that helped us figure out what our driver assignment algorithm should look like. We did customer support ourselves, you know? Getting real time feedback from our customers. I remember, you know, for the first few months when we got started, we would manually e-mail every single one of our new customers at the end of every night, just asking them how was your first delivery, how did you hear about us? And we would personalize all these e-mails, right? Like if I see someone order chicken skewers from Oren's Hummus, I would say I love Oren's hummus. How were your chicken skewers? How did the first delivery go? You know, just feedback like that was really valuable and customers really, really appreciated that. And I remember one time, this is during YC, we were out of, we just came out of a meeting with one of our restaurant partners, and we heard about this ice cream store that just opened up on University Avenue, called Cream, and we wanted to go try it out.

所以他只是给那里的几个朋友发了邮件，一切问题就都解决了。是的，关于做那些无法规模化的事情还有一点，就是它也能让你成为自己业务领域的专家。对吧？比如开车送餐帮助我们理解配送流程是如何运作的。我们利用这个机会与顾客交流，与我们的餐厅沟通。我们亲自做调度工作，这帮助我们弄清楚如何手动调度每个司机。而这又帮助我们确定了司机分配算法应该是什么样子。我们亲自做客户支持，知道吗？从客户那里获得实时反馈。我记得，在我们刚开始的头几个月，我们会在每晚结束时手动给每个新客户发邮件，只是问他们第一次配送体验如何，是怎么听说我们的？我们会个性化所有这些邮件，对吧？比如如果我看到有人从 Oren's Hummus 点了鸡肉串，我会说我很喜欢 Oren's 鹰嘴豆泥。你的鸡肉串怎么样？第一次配送顺利吗？你知道，像这样的反馈真的非常宝贵，客户也非常非常感激。我记得有一次，那是在 YC 期间，我们刚和一家餐厅合作伙伴开完会出来，听说 University Avenue 上新开了一家叫 Cream 的冰淇淋店，我们想去尝尝。

And then, all of a sudden, our co-founder back at our office/house texted us saying, oh we need drivers on the road, we got a huge spike in demand. So we debated for maybe ten seconds like should we go get ice cream or should we go deliver? Obviously, we went and delivered. But that kinda became our motivation on scaling, right. Like if we can scale then, you could go get ice cream next time.

然后突然间，我们在办公室/家里的联合创始人发短信说，我们需要司机上路，我们的需求激增。所以我们争论了大概十秒钟，是应该去买冰淇淋还是去送货？显然，我们选择了去送货。但这某种程度上成为了我们扩大规模的动力。如果我们能够扩大规模，下次你就可以去买冰淇淋了。

So yeah, I think that kinda, and now, of course, we've scaled up across different cities. Now you have to worry about building out automated solutions and dispatch systems, and figuring out how do you match demand and supply, and all that fancy technology stuff. But none of that mattered at the beginning. Because at the beginning, it's all about getting this thing off the ground and trying to find product market fit.

所以是的，我想这某种程度上，现在当然我们已经扩展到不同城市。现在你必须担心构建自动化解决方案和调度系统，以及如何匹配供需，还有所有那些花哨的技术问题。但所有这些在开始时都不重要。因为在开始时，最重要的是让事情起步并尝试找到产品市场契合度。

So, just to summarize. So the three things I would say that I learned from doing DoorDash is first, test your hypothesis, you wanna treat your startup ideas like experiments. The second thing is launch fast. We launched in less than an hour, where we released a full landing page. And finally, it's okay to do things that don't scale. Doing things that don't scale is one of your biggest competitive advantages when you're starting out. And you can figure out how to scale once you have the demand. And, maybe once you've scaled, then you go get that ice cream.

那么，总结一下。我想说从做 DoorDash 中学到的三件事是：第一，测试你的假设，你应该把创业想法当作实验来对待。第二是快速发布。我们在不到一小时内就发布了完整的着陆页面。最后，做不可扩展的事情是可以的。当你刚开始时，做不可扩展的事情是你最大的竞争优势之一。一旦有了需求，你就可以想办法扩大规模。也许一旦你扩大了规模，就可以去买那个冰淇淋了。

Thanks. So the question was, how did our first customer hear about us? Our very first one, I have no idea. We just launched PaloAltodelivery.com. We didn't do any marketing. So I assume he just must have typed in Palo Alto delivery into the web browser. And then after that, we didn't do, we did barely any marketing. I think I sent out like one email to my dorm. And that was about it. It was all through word of mouth and that kind of just validates. You know, just how strong of a need you found. You know, when people just start talking about you and they're willing to put up with all this, you know, terrible user experience, terrible design, and stuff like that.

谢谢。问题是我们的第一个客户是如何听说我们的？对于第一个客户，我完全不知道。我们刚刚上线了 PaloAltodelivery.com，没有做任何营销。所以我猜他可能只是在浏览器中输入了"Palo Alto delivery"。在那之后，我们几乎没有做任何营销。我想我只给宿舍发了一封邮件。仅此而已。完全是通过口碑传播，这正好验证了需求的强烈程度。当人们开始谈论你，并且愿意忍受糟糕的用户体验、糟糕的设计等等时，你就知道这个需求有多强烈。

When you started, it seemed so obvious that you were wondering why no one's done this. What's your answer now? With that. Yeah, I mean, looking back, I think the biggest thing is mobile. The fact that now everyone has one of those in their pocket. And we kinda saw that trend and thought, you know, what if you can design a delivery system that's entirely based off mobile, where you don't have to have any infrastructure or delivery fleets. Instead, you could, you know, instead of hiring drivers full time, purchasing vehicles, what if you can tap into a more on demand pool of independent contractors, and only send orders to them when they have time. So, that's kind of the insight we had, we, everything was done through mobile. Yeah.

当你开始时，这个想法看起来如此明显，你还在想为什么没人做这个。现在你的答案是什么？是的，回顾过去，我认为最大的因素是移动技术。现在每个人口袋里都有一部手机。我们看到了这个趋势并思考，如果设计一个完全基于移动端的配送系统会怎样，不需要任何基础设施或配送车队。相反，你可以利用按需服务的独立承包商资源，而不是全职雇佣司机或购买车辆，只在他们有时间的时侯派单给他们。这就是我们的洞察，一切都是通过移动端完成的。是的。

[Did you know you were gonna be a startup, or just making some money on a website, at first?]
[你最初是打算创立一家初创公司，还是只想通过网站赚点钱？]

[你们是先推出手机应用还是网站？从想法到首次发布用了多长时间？]

[Yeah, we started with this landing page right here. Took us an hour to launch.]
[是的，我们就是从这里的着陆页开始的。发布花了一个小时。]

[How does DoorDash stand out in a space filled with and other companies.]
[DoorDash 如何在充满竞争的环境中脱颖而出。]

[是的，问题是我们要多久才注册成为公司？当我们参加 YC 时。我们在 2013 年 1 月发布，然后在那个夏天参加了 YC，当我们决定带着这个想法通过 YC 时，我们就注册成立了。]

How does DoorDash stand out in a space filled with other companies? What do you plan to do next, or where do you plan to go with this besides food delivery? I mean, the question was where do we plan to go beyond food delivery? For us, when we started DoorDash, it was always about helping small business owners and figuring out how to service any local merchant, whether you are a macaron store or a restaurant or a furniture shop. That's still our focus, that's like the long-term vision. For now we're just focused on delivery as a way to scale, but ultimately that's where we want to end up.

DoorDash 如何在充满其他公司的领域中脱颖而出？除了食品配送，你们接下来计划做什么，或者打算朝什么方向发展？我的意思是，问题是除了食品配送，我们计划向什么方向发展？对我们来说，当我们创立 DoorDash 时，始终都是关于帮助小企业主，并找出如何为任何本地商家提供服务的方法，无论你是马卡龙店、餐厅还是家具店。这仍然是我们的重点，就像是长期愿景。目前我们只专注于配送作为扩大规模的方式，但最终这就是我们想要达到的目标。

I almost rejected them. It sounds like a dumb idea, but now they're doing hundreds of millions as a startup. That's how you're able to do things that don't scale. I define things that don't scale as things that are fundamentally unsustainable. They will not last, they will not bring in the millionth user. When they break, it's usually time, but it could be a number of other things. These are really growth strategies that won't take you to a million users. There are three real places I want to focus on today. First one is finding your first users. The second one is turning those users into champions, and the third one is finding your product and market fit.

我几乎拒绝了他们。这听起来像个愚蠢的想法，但现在他们作为初创公司已经做到了数亿美元。这就是你能够做那些无法规模化的事情的方式。我将无法规模化的事情定义为本质上不可持续的事情。它们不会持久，不会带来第一百万个用户。当它们崩溃时，通常是因为时间问题，但也可能是其他一些因素。这些确实是无法让你获得百万用户的增长策略。今天我想重点讨论三个实际领域。首先是找到你的首批用户。其次是将这些用户转变为拥护者，第三是找到你的产品与市场契合点。

So finding your first users, the first thing you have to understand is that there is no silver bullet for user acquisition. Everybody, and this includes me when we got started, you look for that dream solution, that pay-per-click campaign that has tremendous ROI, some accelerating partnership that's gonna springboard you into the stratosphere, an affiliate agreement, something that solves it for you. But the reality is for the vast majority of companies, and in fact for every company that I've had the chance to speak to CEO of, that's just not possible. Those are unicorns, and most of the companies that from the outside look like they've had this dream growth curve, the reality is that those first users were impossibly hard to get. Let me tell you about the story of a ridiculously unsustainable business. So this is Teespring in 2012. When we first launched, the business couldn't have looked worse. It took days of meetings. We had to offer free design and days of revisions back and forth. We'd have to launch the product ourselves. We'd have to do the social media. All to sell like 50 shirts for a local non-profit and generate $1,000 of revenue. Anybody looking in would have said you guys need to give up, this is a terrible idea. But as time went on, those users started to add up. I think something you have to understand is that when you first launch a company, just by virtue of the fact that it's a new product, you're gonna be bad at selling it, right? You've got no idea what the paying points of customers really are. You've never sold it before. You don't have any success stories to point to or testimonials. Those first users are always going to be the hardest, and so it's your responsibility as a founder to do whatever it takes to bring in your first users, and it's gonna be different for every company. The common thread that I hear is founders need to spend personal time and effort, a lot of their personal time and effort to bring those users in themselves. It can mean a number of things: everything from sending 100 emails a day, getting on the phone and just calling as many people as you can, going through a network if you have a network like Stanford or Y Combinator. Anything you can do to get that first user, and I really equate it to pushing a boulder up a hill. If you think of like a very sort of smooth hill, when you get started, the incline is the steepest and those first inches are the hardest. Over time as you get farther and farther, the incline stays out and it gets easier.

寻找首批用户时，首先要明白用户获取没有万能解决方案。每个人——包括我创业初期——都在寻找那种理想方案：投资回报率极高的按点击付费广告、能让你一飞冲天的加速合作伙伴关系、联盟协议，或是能为你解决问题的任何方法。但现实是，对绝大多数公司而言——实际上我接触过的每位 CEO 都表示——这根本不可能实现。那些都是凤毛麟角，大多数表面上拥有理想增长曲线的公司，实际上获取首批用户都异常艰难。让我讲述一个极其不可持续的创业故事。这就是 2012 年的 Teespring。我们刚推出时，业务状况糟糕透顶。需要连续多日开会讨论。我们必须提供免费设计和反复修改的服务。我们必须亲自推广产品。我们必须运营社交媒体。所有这些努力只为向当地非营利组织售出 50 件 T 恤，创造 1000 美元收入。任何旁观者都会说你们应该放弃，这个想法太糟糕了。但随着时间推移，这些用户开始累积。你需要明白的是，初次创立公司时，仅因为这是新产品，你的销售能力就会很生疏。你完全不了解客户真正的付费动机。你从未销售过这类产品。你没有任何成功案例或客户评价可供参考。首批用户永远是最难获取的，因此作为创始人，你的责任就是不惜一切代价吸引首批用户，这对每家公司而言都各不相同。我听到的共同点是创始人需要投入个人时间和精力，大量个人时间和精力来亲自吸引这些用户。这可能意味着多种方式：从每天发送 100 封邮件、不停拨打电话联系尽可能多的人，到利用人脉网络——如果你拥有斯坦福或 Y Combinator 这类资源。任何能获取首批用户的方法，我都将其比作推石上山。想象一座光滑的山坡，起步时坡度最陡峭，最初几英寸最为艰难。随着你越推越远，坡度逐渐平缓，过程也会越来越轻松。

Effort to bring those users hopefully, eventually you reached a point where you're at the top of the hill and the boulder starts to roll on its own. Those first users, you just cannot focus on ROI in the sense of time. Do not expect to spend an hour and return thousands of dollars. Maybe Stanley is one of those unicorns that was a pretty incredible story. But for most of us, those first users are going to take a lot of hand holding, a lot of personal love, and that's okay. That's essential for building a company. The one sort of caveat of that is that I don't recommend giving away your product for free, and there's plenty of exceptions to this rule. But in general, cutting costs or giving the product away is an unsustainable strategy I wouldn't recommend. You need to make sure that users value your product. People have a different way of treating products that are free compared to paid products. Often times it can give you a false sense of security if you think, "Oh, we're getting all these users, surely we can convert them over to paid." The second aspect is what happens when you get those users: how do you turn those users into champions? A champion is a user who talks about and advocates for your product. I'm a firm believer that every company with a great growth strategy has users who are champions. The easiest way to turn a user into a champion is to delight them with an experience they're going to remember - something that's unusual or out of the ordinary, an exceptional experience. The easiest way to do this early, and again something that is completely unsustainable and not going to scale forever, is to just talk to them.

努力吸引这些用户，希望最终你能达到一个临界点，就像到达山顶后巨石开始自行滚动。对于最初的用户，你根本不能从时间角度来关注投资回报率。不要指望花费一小时就能获得数千美元的回报。也许斯坦利是那些独角兽公司之一，这是一个相当不可思议的故事。但对我们大多数人来说，那些最初的用户需要大量的手把手指导，大量的个人关爱，这没关系。这对建立公司至关重要。其中一个需要注意的是，我不建议免费赠送你的产品，当然这条规则有很多例外。但总的来说，削减成本或免费赠送产品是我不会推荐的不可持续策略。你需要确保用户重视你的产品。人们对免费产品和付费产品的态度截然不同。很多时候，如果你想着"哦，我们获得了这么多用户，肯定能把他们转化为付费用户"，这会给你一种虚假的安全感。第二个方面是当你获得这些用户后会发生什么：你如何将这些用户转变为拥护者？拥护者是指那些会谈论并推广你的产品的用户。我坚信，每个拥有优秀增长策略的公司都有用户成为其拥护者。将用户转变为拥护者最简单的方法是用让他们难忘的体验来取悦他们——一些不寻常或与众不同的特殊体验。早期实现这一目标最简单的方法，同样也是完全不可持续且无法永久扩展的方法，就是直接与他们交流。

Hopefully, eventually those users and people will say this all the time, and you hear it. It's one of the sort of core tenets of why combinatorics talk to users, but I cannot stress how important it is that you spend a large chunk of your time talking to users. You should do it constantly, every single day, and as long as possible. Today at Teespring, I'm still the catch-all email address, so anytime somebody misspells support or writes an email address that doesn't exist, I get that email. I still do about 12 to 20 customer service tickets every single day. I spend hours each night reading every single tweet, probably a little bit OCD, but that's okay. I read through all the Teespring communities. You're never gonna get a better sense for your product than actually listening to real users. Especially in the early days, the products you launch with and the feature set you launch with is almost certainly not going to be the feature set that you scale with. The quicker you talk to users and learn what they actually need, the faster you can get to that point. So there are three ways to talk to your customers: you can run customer service yourself. Up until Teespring was doing about $130,000-$140,000 a month, my co-founder Evan and I did everything in customer service. This is one that there's gonna be an instinct to quickly pass off, and that's because it's painful. Even today, when I open our customer service portal, I have like an emotional reaction where my stomach sinks because it sucks talking to users who have had a terrible experience and it's painful.

希望最终那些用户和人们会经常这样说，而你也能够听到。这是组合数学强调与用户交流的核心原则之一，但我必须强调花大量时间与用户交流的重要性。你应该持续不断地这样做，每天都尽可能长时间地进行。如今在 Teespring，我仍然是万能邮箱地址，所以每当有人拼错客服邮箱或写了不存在的邮箱地址，我都会收到那封邮件。我每天仍然要处理大约 12 到 20 个客服工单。我每晚花数小时阅读每一条推文，可能有点强迫症，但这没关系。我会仔细阅读所有 Teespring 社区的内容。没有什么比真正倾听真实用户更能让你了解自己的产品了。特别是在早期阶段，你最初推出的产品和功能集几乎肯定不是你最终规模化发展时所用的功能集。你越快与用户交流并了解他们的实际需求，就能越早达到那个目标。与客户交流有三种方式：你可以亲自处理客户服务。在 Teespring 月收入达到约 13 万至 14 万美元之前，我的联合创始人 Evan 和我包办了所有客服工作。这一项工作人们本能地想要快速推卸给别人，因为它确实令人痛苦。即使在今天，当我打开客服门户时，我仍然会有情绪反应，感到胃部不适，因为与那些有过糟糕体验的用户交流很糟糕，这确实很痛苦。

Learn what they actually need. It's something that you love and you put so much effort into, and you've gotten it wrong or they've had a terrible experience or somebody didn't treat them right. But it's so important that you go through that and learn what you need to build, what you need to fix. The second step is to proactively reach out to current and churned customers. Churned customers are customers who have left, and this is one that often falls by the wayside in the pursuit of new customers. But you wanna make sure that your customers are having a consistent, good experience. You don't wanna just leave those current users as sort of, you don't want take them for granted. And then when a user actually leaves your service, you wanna reach out and find out why, both because that personal outreach can make the difference between leaving and staying. Sometimes people just need to know that you care and it's going to get better, and because even if you can't bring them back, there's a chance that you can learn from the mistake that you made that caused them to leave and fix it so you don't churn users out the same way in the future. And the final one is, again, the one that I'm probably too OCD about, but it's social media and communities. You need to know how people are talking about your brand. You need to reach out and make sure that, when somebody does have a bad experience and they're talking about it, that you make it right. Problems are inevitable in start-ups. There's gonna be issues, you're not gonna have the perfect product, things are gonna break, things are gonna go wrong.

了解他们真正需要什么。这是你热爱并投入大量心血的事情，但你可能做错了，或者他们有过糟糕的体验，或者有人没有好好对待他们。但经历这些并了解你需要构建什么、需要修复什么是非常重要的。第二步是主动联系现有客户和流失客户。流失客户是指已经离开的客户，这一点在追求新客户的过程中常常被忽视。但你要确保客户获得持续良好的体验。你不能只是忽视现有用户，不能把他们视为理所当然。当用户真正离开你的服务时，你要主动联系并找出原因，因为这种个人联系可能决定他们是离开还是留下。有时候人们只需要知道你在乎，情况会变得更好。而且即使你无法挽回他们，你也有机会从导致他们离开的错误中吸取教训并进行修复，这样未来就不会以同样的方式流失用户。最后一点，也是我可能过于执着的一点，就是社交媒体和社区。你需要了解人们如何谈论你的品牌。当有人遇到糟糕体验并在讨论时，你需要主动联系并确保纠正问题。在初创企业中问题是不可避免的。总会出现问题，你不会有完美的产品，事情会出错，会出现故障。

That's not important. What's important is to always make it right, to always go the extra mile and make that customer happy. One detractor who has had a terrible experience on your platform is enough to reverse the progress of ten champions. It's all it takes is one person out there to say no. You shouldn't use those guys for X, Y, and Z reason, to ruin a ton of momentum. So even if there are examples in the early days where we would mess up massive orders. We would print the colors slightly wrong, it would be the wrong size and it would be like half of our GMV for that month and we would know we got it wrong. The customer would be unhappy and sort of this instinct is well, it's only a little bit off or it's not completely wrong it'll be fine. But the reality is you've just got to bite the bullet and make sure that it's right, and those customers, the customers that are often originally the most frustrated tend to turn into the biggest champions and the longest term users. And the last one I wanna talk about is finding product and market fit and what I mean that is that I mentioned this earlier. But the product you launch with will almost certainly not be the product that takes you to scale and so your job in those early moments or those early days of a start-up is to progress and iterate as fast as possible to reach that product that does have market fit. And as engineers your instinct is gonna be to build a platform with beautiful clean code that scales right? You don't wanna write sort of duct tape code that's gonna pile on technical debt. But you need to optimize for

那并不重要。重要的是始终把事情做对，始终付出额外努力让客户满意。在你的平台上经历过糟糕体验的一个反对者，就足以抵消十个支持者带来的进步。只需要有一个人站出来说不。你不应该因为 X、Y、Z 等原因使用那些家伙，这会毁掉大量的发展势头。所以即使在早期我们搞砸大订单的例子中。我们会把颜色印得稍有偏差，尺寸会出错，这可能会占我们当月 GMV 的一半，而且我们知道我们搞砸了。客户会不满意，而这种本能反应是，只是稍微有点偏差或者不是完全错误，应该没问题。但现实是你必须硬着头皮确保事情做对，而那些客户，那些最初最沮丧的客户，往往会变成最大的支持者和最长期的用户。我想谈的最后一点是寻找产品和市场契合度，我之前提到过这一点。但你最初推出的产品几乎肯定不是能让你实现规模化的产品，因此在创业的早期阶段，你的工作就是尽可能快地推进和迭代，以达到真正具有市场契合度的产品。作为工程师，你的本能是构建一个具有漂亮整洁代码、可扩展的平台，对吗？你不想写那种会堆积技术债务的临时凑合代码。但你需要优化

But you need to optimize for

In the early days, we had a couple enterprise customers come to us. Sort of bigger non-profits said, hey, we really like your service but you're missing these fundamental things. So we can't use it and we're not gonna use it. We looked at what it would take to build out those features and we weren't sure they were gonna work long-term, but we wanted to try it. My co-founder Evan, who is our CTO and a million times better developer than I am, ran the map and figured out that if we did it the right way, it was gonna take about a month to build out these features. In a start-up, a month you live in dog years. A month is a year and that just wasn't gonna do. So he actually went out, duplicated the code base, duplicated the database and was able to basically build a completely different product that he didn't have to worry about the existing users for, to serve these enterprise customers. We gave them the tool, they on-boarded, they generate a lot of revenue. Eventually, we learned what features were core and we integrated them into the core product. What would have taken a month, we were able to do in three to four days. A great rule of thumb is to only worry about the next order of magnitude. When you have your tenth user, you shouldn't be wondering how are we gonna serve a million users. You should be worried about how are we gonna get to 100? When you're at 100, you should think about 1,000. It's one of those things where necessity is the mother of invention.

早期，我们有几个企业客户来找我们。一些较大的非营利组织说，嘿，我们真的很喜欢你们的服务，但你们缺少这些基本功能。所以我们不能用，我们不会使用它。我们研究了开发这些功能需要什么，虽然不确定它们是否能长期有效，但我们想尝试一下。我的联合创始人埃文，他是我们的首席技术官，也是比我优秀百万倍的开发者，进行了规划并发现，如果我们采用正确的方式，开发这些功能大约需要一个月时间。在初创公司里，一个月就像狗年一样漫长。一个月相当于一年，这根本行不通。所以他实际上另起炉灶，复制了代码库，复制了数据库，基本上能够构建一个完全不同的产品，不必担心现有用户，专门为这些企业客户服务。我们给了他们工具，他们入驻了，产生了大量收入。最终，我们了解了哪些功能是核心，并将它们整合到核心产品中。原本需要一个月完成的事情，我们能够在三到四天内完成。一个很好的经验法则是只担心下一个数量级的问题。当你有第十个用户时，你不应该考虑如何服务一百万个用户。你应该担心的是如何达到一百个用户？当你达到一百个时，你应该考虑一千个。这就是那种需要是发明之母的情况。

Speed over scalability. So when you hit that breaking point, like the Twitter Fail Whale is a great example and Teespring. There were months, month stretches where every single night, the site would crash, every night and during the day. And every single person on the team would go to sleep with their phone on loud under their pillow so that inevitably, when the buzzer went off, we could quickly get up, restart the servers and go back to sleep. And this would happen daily. But the reality is that it was worth it and you'll end up with these huge pain points and all this technical debt and regret. But it's worth it, just to get to that end goal and that product fit faster. You will make it work, you will survive. Those sort of bumps are just speed bumps and speed is so, so important early. So the lesson that I've been learning lately is you want to do these things that don't scale as long as possible. There's not some magical moment, it's not the series A, it's not when you hit a certain revenue milestone that you stop doing things that don't scale. This is one of your biggest advantages as a company, and the moment you give it up, you're giving your competitors that are smaller that can still do things that advantage over you. So as long as humanly possible, as long as it is a net positive, you need to be spending time talking to your users. You need to move fast in development, as fast as possible. But don't give it up willingly, it should be ripped from you. And so sort of trying to practice what I preach, I wanna give you guys my email address.

速度优先于可扩展性。所以当你达到那个临界点时，比如 Twitter 的失败鲸就是一个很好的例子，还有 Teespring。有几个月的时间，每天晚上网站都会崩溃，无论是晚上还是白天。团队中的每个人都会把手机调成最大音量放在枕头下睡觉，这样当警报响起时，我们就能迅速起床，重启服务器，然后继续睡觉。这种情况每天都会发生。但现实是这是值得的，你最终会面临这些巨大的痛点、技术债务和遗憾。但为了更快达到最终目标和产品市场契合，这是值得的。你会让它运转起来，你会挺过去。这类障碍只是减速带，而速度在早期阶段非常重要。所以我最近学到的教训是，你要尽可能长时间地做那些不可扩展的事情。并不存在某个神奇的时刻，不是 A 轮融资，也不是当你达到某个收入里程碑时，你就停止做不可扩展的事情。这是你作为公司最大的优势之一，当你放弃它的那一刻，你就是在把这个优势让给那些规模较小但仍能灵活行事的竞争对手。所以只要人力可为，只要它是净收益，你就需要花时间与用户交流。你需要在开发中快速行动，尽可能快。但不要轻易放弃，它应该被强行夺走。为了实践我所宣扬的理念，我想给你们我的电子邮件地址。

If you guys have any questions, if you wanna learn about Teespring, if you wanna print some t-shirts, just shoot me an email. I'd love to help and I'd love to speak to you. And the last thing is we've created an official how to start a start up tee with Sam. And all proceeds are going to Watsi. I couldn't miss this opportunity to sell. So if you guys wanna grab one of the official tees, just go to teespring.com/startup and it's supporting a great cause. Thank you.

如果大家有任何问题，如果想了解 Teespring，如果想印制一些 T 恤，请直接给我发邮件。我很乐意帮助并与大家交流。最后要说的是，我们与 Sam 合作推出了一款官方创业主题 T 恤。所有收益都将捐赠给 Watsi 组织。我不想错过这个销售机会。如果大家想购买这款官方 T 恤，请访问 teespring.com/startup，这同时也在支持一项伟大的事业。谢谢。

Fingers crossed nothing matched my needs. And so, because I knew that I had that pain point, and I knew there was market fit, and I had seen people adopt the product, I knew there was something there. It was also one of those things where you can sort of feel the wind on your back where people are adopting the product quickly, the pain point is clearly there. It's not a met need. So, I would say that oftentimes great ideas start by looking like silly ideas. And then you can sort of feel out whether or not there's a scalable business here by how people are adopting it. Is it possible to bring customers aboard? Sure. Are non-profits your biggest customer base? No. Today our biggest customer base are entrepreneurs who are trying to build brands and businesses. We have a little over a 1,000 people that make their full time living on Teespring today via brands they've launched, and the other side is influencers - YouTube stars, Reddit communities, bloggers who want to add product merchandise as a way to sort of create a brand and monetize that affinity. So those are our two biggest markets. We still do work with a lot of non-profits and love working with them. It's still a part of our business just not the majority.

我祈祷没有什么能满足我的需求。因此，因为我知道自己有这个痛点，也知道存在市场契合度，并且看到人们采用了这个产品，我就知道这里面有东西。这也是那种你能感受到背后有风推着你前进的情况——人们快速采用产品，痛点明显存在。这不是一个已被满足的需求。所以我想说，伟大的想法往往一开始看起来都很愚蠢。然后你可以通过人们如何采用它来感受这里是否存在可扩展的业务。有可能吸引客户吗？当然。非营利组织是你们最大的客户群吗？不是。如今我们最大的客户群是试图建立品牌和企业的创业者。目前有超过 1000 人通过他们在 Teespring 上推出的品牌实现全职谋生，另一方面是影响者——YouTube 明星、Reddit 社区、博主，他们希望通过添加产品商品来创建品牌并将这种亲和力变现。所以这是我们最大的两个市场。我们仍然与许多非营利组织合作，并且喜欢与他们合作。这仍然是我们业务的一部分，只是不是主要部分。

Cool. Well, while I wait for the slide to happen, I started a bunch of startups but I think you've heard a lot of awesome stories about how I got started. So I'm gonna talk about something very specific that people always have questions with, which is press and how do you get it. How does it work? This is kind of like an abridged version of what we talked about at Y Combinator and hopefully you guys will find it helpful. So, a lot of people, I think when they first get started with entrepreneurship, think about getting press and being in the press as something that happens magically. They think about it as something that journalists out there are trying to find the best stories and discover the meritocracy, which is absolutely not the case. So before you think about press, one of the things you really want to think about is who you want to reach and what's your actual goal. A lot of people, like I know when I got started I wanted to just be in the news because I thought that's what you did as an important company. And it turns out if you don't have any goals you're not gonna achieve them. That's true of pretty much everything, and with press, if you just aimlessly want to be covered, it's not really going to do anything for your startup. So getting in the news is nice because you can send it to your mom and say hey, I have a real job.

好的。在我等待幻灯片播放的时候，我想说我创办过很多初创公司，但我觉得你们已经听过很多关于我如何起步的精彩故事了。所以我要谈一个非常具体的话题，人们总是对此有疑问，那就是媒体报道以及如何获得报道。它是如何运作的？这有点像我们在 Y Combinator 讨论内容的精简版，希望你们会觉得有帮助。很多人，我认为当他们刚开始创业时，会把获得媒体报道和登上新闻看作某种神奇发生的事情。他们认为这就像是记者们在外面试图寻找最好的故事，发现精英人才，但实际情况完全不是这样。所以在考虑媒体报道之前，你真正需要思考的是你想要触达谁，以及你的实际目标是什么。很多人，比如我知道自己刚开始时，只是想登上新闻，因为我认为这是重要公司该做的事。事实证明，如果你没有任何目标，你就无法实现它们。这几乎适用于所有事情，对于媒体报道来说，如果你只是盲目地想要被报道，这对你的初创公司并不会真正带来任何好处。所以登上新闻是件好事，因为你可以把它发给你妈妈看，然后说：嘿，我有一份正经工作了。

You know, look, we're in the New York Times. But if you don't have an actual goal for your business with it, it's really just not a good use of time. So, you know, there's many different goals.

One example is, you might want to, with Social Cam, which is a spin off of Justin TV, it was like an app that was kind of like video Instagram. And our goal was really to be known as a video Instagram app, and be thought of in that context when it was time to pitch to our Silicon Valley investors and influencers. And so, we really wanted to get in tech press and be positioned as this new, hot social app.

With Exec, one of my goals was to get customers. So, Exec was a local cleaning service and our goal was to get people in San Francisco to use it. It wasn't useful to get the national press because 99% of those people couldn't use it. So, we really targeted initially a lot of SF Chronicle and local San Francisco press that would directly talk to people who could potentially use our app.

For Twitch, which is probably the thing that you guys mostly know. It was Twitch was ESPN for gaming or kind of like a live streaming community of gamers. And our goal was with press was to reach the gaming industry. Because when we started now it's like 55 million uniques and people in the gaming industry know about it. But when we started nobody really knew that it was a place to advertise.

要知道，我们登上了《纽约时报》。但如果你没有明确的商业目标，这实际上只是在浪费时间。所以，有很多不同的目标。

举个例子，Social Cam 是 Justin TV 的衍生品，它有点像视频版的 Instagram。我们的目标是被视为视频 Instagram 应用，在向硅谷投资者和影响者推介时能够被这样看待。因此，我们非常希望进入科技媒体视野，被定位为一款热门的新社交应用。

至于 Exec，我的目标之一是获取客户。Exec 是一项本地清洁服务，我们的目标是让旧金山的人们使用它。获得全国性媒体报道并没有用，因为 99% 的人用不上这项服务。所以我们最初主要针对《旧金山纪事报》和当地媒体，这些媒体能直接接触到可能使用我们应用的潜在用户。

Twitch 可能是大家最熟悉的。Twitch 是游戏界的 ESPN，或者说是一个游戏玩家的实时流媒体社区。我们通过媒体宣传的目标是触达游戏产业。因为现在我们有 5500 万独立用户，游戏行业的人都知道它。但刚开始的时候，没人知道这是个可以投放广告的地方。

We were a very nascent small gaming community, and our goal was to get people in the gaming industry, whether they were developers or advertisers, to think about us as an important place where influences were. So we really targeted industry trades and game depth logs, places where gamers want to have games speed and stuff like that, the industry was reading.

我们是一个刚刚起步的小型游戏社区，我们的目标是让游戏行业的人们，无论是开发者还是广告商，将我们视为一个有影响力的重要平台。因此我们主要针对行业媒体和游戏深度博客进行推广，这些正是玩家关注游戏资讯、行业人士经常阅读的渠道。

There are a bunch of different types of stories, but these are usually the ones that you see in startups. Those are like product launches, such as launching a new version of your app. There's fundraising for whatever reason, press loves to write about fundraising even though it's not very interesting. So if you raise a $1 million seed round, pretty much you can get that covered.

实际上存在多种不同类型的故事，但这些通常是你在初创公司中常见的类型。比如产品发布，像是推出新版本的应用。还有各种原因的融资报道，尽管融资本身并不十分有趣，但媒体总是热衷于报道这类消息。所以如果你筹集了 100 万美元的种子轮资金，基本上都能获得媒体报道。

Milestones or metrics like achieving a $1 million dollars a week in revenue, that one company that bought Exec just announced that they achieved a $1 million dollars a week in revenue and was covered pretty widely. Business stories generally happen when you're already a successful company. Someone like New York Times or New Yorker business magazine will want to cover the story of your startup, but usually don't have to worry about that in the beginning.

里程碑或关键指标，比如实现每周 100 万美元的收入，那家收购 Exec 的公司刚刚宣布他们实现了每周 100 万美元的收入，并获得了广泛报道。商业故事通常发生在你已经是一家成功企业时。《纽约时报》或《纽约客》商业杂志这类媒体会想要报道你的创业故事，但在初期通常不需要担心这个问题。

What I like to call stunts, which are like, I don't know if you guys remember, but a couple of years ago, this YC company called WePay dropped a block of ice with money frozen in it outside of the PayPal office.

我称之为营销噱头的类型，比如我不知道你们是否记得，几年前有家 YC 公司叫 WePay，他们在 PayPal 办公室外放置了一块里面冻着钱的冰块。

It wasn't like a developers conference. Because PayPal was in the news for freezing various developers accounts. That was widely covered because it was such an interesting thing, and it really got them in the story. They wouldn't have been talked about in the context of PayPal at all really. Hiring announcements, if you're a big enough company and you hire someone really important, people will want to cover that. Then there are contributed articles, like writing some sort of industry overview or opinion piece in a tech blog or similar platforms. So basically any of those things can be stories. One of the things that people usually don't think about is that you really have to think about everything when you start a startup. You think that everything you're doing is interesting, but that's not true for other people. What you really need to think about is objectively: if I wasn't the founder of this company, would I want to read a story about what I'm pitching? You have incremental feature releases or 2.01 feature releases that might not be interesting, just because you added something like finding your contacts on Facebook or something. You really want to take a step back before you invest the time in actually trying to pitch a story and think: will anyone actually want to read this?

这不像是一个开发者大会。因为 PayPal 因冻结各种开发者账户而登上新闻。这件事被广泛报道是因为它非常有趣，确实让他们成为了新闻焦点。否则他们根本不会在 PayPal 的背景下被讨论。招聘公告，如果你是一家足够大的公司，并且雇佣了非常重要的人，人们会想要报道这件事。还有投稿文章，比如在技术博客或类似平台上撰写某种行业概述或观点文章。所以基本上这些事情都可以成为新闻故事。人们通常不会想到的一点是，当你创办一家初创公司时，你真的必须考虑所有事情。你认为你做的每件事都很有趣，但对其他人来说并非如此。你真正需要考虑的是客观地问自己：如果我不是这家公司的创始人，我会想读关于我正在推销的内容的故事吗？你有渐进式功能发布或 2.01 版本的功能发布，这些可能并不有趣，仅仅因为你添加了类似在 Facebook 上查找联系人这样的功能。在你投入时间实际尝试推销故事之前，你真的需要退一步思考：真的会有人想读这个吗？

Because what people are, you know, journalists and bloggers are looking for, is things that people actually want to read, right? The other thing is like, you don't actually have to be very original. Your press in these doesn't have to be original. It just has to be like what I like to call, original enough, right? So you don't want to be the second cooler company to raise $5 million on Kickstarter, right? That's like the first guy gets all the news. But like if you're there, I think the first video game console to raise $10 million on Kickstarter like Ouya was, that was like, it was like $1 million in 24 hours. That was huge news because they were kind of like the first in that category, right? Even though other people have raised a lot of money on Kickstarter before. So just like think about your stories in the context of like where they are in the like what else has been written about and if they're like kind of novel enough and they haven't been something that was like just written about in the news. So what are the actual mechanics of getting a story? This is like pretty tactical, so what if you want to get your news in, you know, the press, basically there's some easy, simple steps. So it's basically, getting press is like, you think of it like a sales funnel. So you're going to talk to a lot of people, and not all of them are going to convert, right? And so you shouldn't be upset when someone, like one individual person or reporter or whatever doesn't write your

因为记者和博主们寻找的，正是人们真正想阅读的内容，对吧？另一件事是，你实际上不必非常有原创性。你的媒体报道不必是原创的。它只需要达到我所说的"足够原创"，对吧？所以你不想成为第二家在 Kickstarter 上筹集 500 万美元的酷公司，对吧？这就好比第一个吃螃蟹的人获得所有报道。但如果你能做到，我认为像 Ouya 那样首个在 Kickstarter 上筹集 1000 万美元的游戏主机，就像它在 24 小时内筹集 100 万美元那样，那才是大新闻，因为他们在那个类别中算是首创，对吧？尽管之前也有其他人在 Kickstarter 上筹集了大量资金。所以要结合背景来思考你的故事，考虑已经有哪些相关报道，以及它们是否足够新颖，是否还没有被新闻报道过。那么获得报道的实际机制是什么？这相当具有策略性，如果你想获得媒体报道，基本上有一些简单易行的步骤。基本上，获得媒体报道就像销售漏斗。你需要与很多人交流，但并非所有人都会转化，对吧？因此当某个人，比如某个记者或其他人不报道你的

You shouldn't be upset when someone, like one individual person or reporter or whatever, doesn't write your story. The first thing is you have to think of a story, right? It's gotta be one of those, probably one of those things that I listed up before. The second step is, you wanna get introduced to a reporter or multiple reporters who are gonna write about your thing. It's much, much easier, just like any sort of business development, to actually get in touch with them through someone. Rather than cold emailing them, the best thing to do I've found is like, you wanna go to entrepreneurs who were just written about, like your friends who maybe started a startup and they were covered on TechCrunch, get them to introduce you to that reporter who wrote about them. The reason that's good is because, from the entrepreneur's perspective, the easiest thing to do in the world is introduce you to a reporter who already wrote about them, right? They don't need anything else from that reporter. They're actually doing that person a favor for stories interesting. It's not like you're asking for interest to investors, or potential people that they would wanna hire, employees. And then, from the reporter's perspective, they're getting intro to someone who they already vetted as interesting. They're getting an answer from someone who they know they thought was interesting enough to talk about. And so, by the transitive property, they're gonna think you're probably interesting.

当某个人，比如某个个人或记者或其他什么人，没有报道你的故事时，你不应该感到沮丧。首先你需要构思一个故事，对吧？它必须是那些我之前列举的事情之一。第二步是，你需要被介绍给将要报道你故事的记者或多个记者。就像任何商业拓展一样，通过某人联系他们要容易得多。我发现最好的做法是去找那些刚被报道过的创业者，比如你那些可能创办了初创公司并在 TechCrunch 上被报道的朋友，让他们把你介绍给报道过他们的记者。这样做的好处在于，从创业者的角度来看，世界上最容易做的事情就是把你介绍给已经报道过他们的记者，对吧？他们不需要从那个记者那里得到其他东西。实际上他们是在帮那个人寻找有趣的故事。这不像你在寻求投资者的兴趣，或者他们可能想要雇佣的员工。然后，从记者的角度来看，他们正在被介绍给一个他们已经核实过很有趣的人。他们正在从一个他们认为足够有趣值得报道的人那里得到回应。因此，通过传递性原理，他们很可能会认为你很有趣。

So you get an email from this guy that introduces you to the reporter, and you want to get in contact with them with enough time that you can actually get them to write a story. Probably a week in advance, or more. Because they're not going to drop everything they're doing to just write about your news. So, a lot of people, especially first time entrepreneurs will come and say, "Justin, I'm launching this product tomorrow. Can you get me in TechCrunch or something?" And that's probably not going to happen unless you already have a relationship.

你会收到一封来自这个人的电子邮件，他将你介绍给记者，你需要有足够的时间与他们联系，以便让他们真正撰写报道。可能需要提前一周或更长时间。因为他们不会放下手头的一切工作来专门报道你的新闻。所以很多人，尤其是初次创业者会来说："贾斯汀，我明天要发布这个产品。你能让我登上 TechCrunch 之类的媒体吗？"除非你已经建立了关系，否则这很可能不会发生。

The best way to do it is to give yourself some lead time. Get that introduction in advance. Once you've set a date for your news to go out, you're going to launch your product in two weeks, you have this introduction, you set up some sort of meeting and you really want to get the reporter to invest time and effort into you. Because there's kind of a sunk-cost fallacy at play. Basically, the more time they spend with you, the more likely they are to actually write something.

最好的方法是给自己留出一些准备时间。提前获得介绍。一旦你确定了新闻发布的日期，比如你将在两周内发布产品，你有了这个介绍，安排了某种会议，你真正想要的是让记者在你身上投入时间和精力。因为这里存在一种沉没成本谬误在起作用。基本上，他们花在你身上的时间越多，他们实际撰写报道的可能性就越大。

So the best thing to do is to get a face to face meeting. Lots of reporters and bloggers actively don't want to meet you face to face. But if not that, then get a phone call and get on the phone with them. The worst thing to do is just have an email exchange, right? Because it's very easy for them to forget about it or ignore it.

所以最好的做法是安排面对面会议。很多记者和博主实际上并不想与你面对面会面。但如果不是面对面，那就安排电话沟通。最糟糕的做法就是仅仅通过电子邮件交流，对吗？因为他们很容易忘记或忽略邮件。

So you want to actually try to get in contact with them and set up a meeting. Okay. The next step is actually to pitch them. What I usually do is write out all my ideas, like the story that I would want to see published, in bullet points. I will write out the story, my ideal story, and memorize it. I memorize the entire set of bullet points, and when I have a conversation with them, if it's in person, I'll walk them through this. I'll have a conversation that's structured like my outline, and they'll be taking notes. Then they'll go and transcribe those notes into a story. So what I wrote will eventually be translated into an actual story. By preparing, you can much more easily control the conversation and not forget critical things, like mentioning your co-founder's name or what all the features in your awesome app are. If I'm doing this on the phone, I will have these bullet points in front of me and make sure to walk through a conversation that includes all of those things. So you do that, you have a pitch, they take notes, and they're going to write the story this time. Then the next thing is to follow up. A couple of days or the day before your actual news goes out, you want to send them an email that says this is the time we're launching the app and thanks for meeting.

所以你需要实际联系他们并安排会议。好的。下一步实际上是向他们进行推介。我通常的做法是把所有想法，比如我希望看到发表的故事，用要点形式写出来。我会写出这个故事，我理想中的故事，并记住它。我会记住所有的要点，当我和他们交谈时，如果是当面交流，我会引导他们了解这些内容。我会按照我的大纲结构进行对话，他们会做笔记。然后他们会把这些笔记整理成一个故事。所以我写的内容最终会被转化为一个实际的故事。通过准备，你可以更容易地控制对话，不会忘记关键事项，比如提到你联合创始人的名字，或者你优秀应用中的所有功能。如果是在电话中进行，我会把这些要点放在面前，确保对话涵盖所有这些内容。所以你这样做，你进行了推介，他们做了笔记，这次他们会写这个故事。然后下一步是跟进。在你实际新闻发布前几天或前一天，你需要给他们发一封邮件，说明这是我们发布应用的时间，并感谢会面。

Thanks for meeting. Here's collateral, maybe if you have videos or photos or something you want them to include screenshots. Include how to spell your co-founders' names and your name. Just include all the information that I really care about and I bold it right? Then that's it. Then hopefully the day comes you press submit on the release to the app store and at the same time they release their article on TechCrunch and you are famous.

感谢会面。这是相关资料，如果你有视频、照片或其他希望他们包含的内容，请附上截图。包括如何拼写联合创始人和你自己的名字。只需包含我真正关心的所有信息，我会加粗标记，对吧？就这样。然后希望那天到来时，你点击提交应用商店发布，同时他们在 TechCrunch 上发表文章，你就出名了。

Okay, so a lot of people ask us about PR firms. What are you doing? What's the roadmap of interesting things that you're working on? They're also really expensive. I think we were spending between $5,000 and $20,000 a month, which is a lot for a startup for various firms, right? It's generally not a good use of money, I would say, especially in the very early days. Getting press is a lot of work, so you should really make sure it's worth it. Like I said, getting press doesn't mean it's like a vanity metric, right? It feels like you're being successful because lots of successful companies like Google and Facebook are covered in the press all the time. But it doesn't actually mean you're successful. It doesn't actually give you mean that you're getting money, you're getting users, you're making those users happy. Sometimes it's a really good strategy for getting your first 100, or 200, or 1,000 customers. But it's really not a scalable user acquisition strategy, so it's something that's really just like a bootstrap. You can't just get infinity articles written about you. Eventually people are going to get tired of hearing about your company, and usually that happens pretty quickly, right? The whole point about news is that it's new, and so it's pretty hard, unless you're Google, to get covered in the press like every week with something.

很多人会问我们关于公关公司的事情。你们在做什么？你们正在开发的有趣项目的路线图是什么？而且它们确实很昂贵。我认为我们每月花费在 5000 到 20000 美元之间，对于初创公司来说，对不同的公司来说都是一大笔钱，对吧？总的来说这不是一个好的资金使用方式，尤其是在早期阶段。获得媒体报道需要大量工作，所以你应该确保这是值得的。就像我说的，获得媒体报道并不意味着它就像虚荣指标，对吧？感觉你正在成功，因为很多成功的公司如谷歌和 Facebook 总是被媒体报道。但这并不真正意味着你成功了。它实际上并不能给你带来收入，不能带来用户，不能让这些用户满意。有时这是获取前 100、200 或 1000 名客户的很好策略。但这确实不是一个可扩展的用户获取策略，所以它更像是一个启动策略。你不可能无限地获得关于你的文章报道。最终人们会厌倦听到关于你公司的消息，通常这种情况发生得相当快，对吧？新闻的关键在于它是新的，所以除非你是谷歌，否则很难每周都有关于你的报道。

If you decide it's worth it, you do want to have a regular heartbeat of news. So that's like something where you're planning out those types of what you're doing that matches those maybe seven story types in the future. When I was working primarily on marketing and PR, I would make a schedule on a calendar, have when we're gonna launch things and make sure to space them out, but have them appear regular at regular intervals so that people didn't want to forget about us and we could maximize our coverage. You might really want to keep your contacts fresh. It's really a relationships business. Once someone writes about you, you should keep going back to them for more writing about you in the future. It's kind of like when basically people are more likely to do something for someone you've already done something for. I would try to establish good relationships with a couple reporters over time that you can go to break news. It will come in handy later if you ever are in the position where people are writing negative things about you. Having relationships will help you get your side of the story out. The last thing is it's kind of Golden Rule really, or maybe more like pay it forward really applies here.

如果你认为值得这样做，你确实需要保持新闻发布的规律性。这就需要你规划那些与你未来可能涉及的七种故事类型相匹配的内容。当我主要从事市场营销和公关工作时，我会在日历上制定时间表，安排产品发布时间并确保间隔合理，但同时保持定期出现的频率，这样人们就不会忘记我们，我们也能最大化媒体覆盖。你可能真的需要保持联系人的活跃度。这本质上是一种关系业务。一旦有人报道过你，你就应该持续与他们保持联系，以便未来获得更多报道机会。这基本上就像人们更愿意为那些曾经帮助过自己的人做事。我会尝试与几位记者建立良好的长期关系，以便在有重大新闻时能够联系他们。如果你将来遇到有人撰写负面报道的情况，这种关系会派上用场。良好的人际关系能帮助你传达自己的立场。最后一点就像是黄金法则，或者更准确地说，类似于"传递善意"的原则在这里确实适用。

You should really help your fellow entrepreneurs get coverage, because they will help you get coverage. The best way to get covered is really through these warm introductions. Whenever I'm meeting with reporters, I always help by throwing out the names of other things that I think would be interesting stories for them. And usually that comes back. The reporters like it because it's like helping them find interesting stories. And you're more likely to get leads back from entrepreneurs that you help out. So if you're interested in learning more about press, here are two resources that I really liked. Jason Kincaid, who was a former TechCrunch reporter, wrote a really great overview that covers a lot of things I just talked about in more depth and from the blogger side. That was a really great book. And then kind of an evil resource is this book Trust Me, I'm Lying, which was written by one of the former marketers at American Apparel. He talks about a lot of ways that he pretty evilly manipulated the press, but I think it's a pretty good look into the psychology of how things spread on the internet, how stories spread on the internet. It might be valuable to take a look at. Cool, that's basically it.

你真的应该帮助其他创业者获得媒体报道，因为他们也会帮助你获得报道。获得报道的最佳方式实际上是通过这些热情的引荐。每当我和记者见面时，我总是会提出一些我认为对他们来说可能是有趣故事的其他事情。通常这会带来回报。记者们喜欢这样，因为这就像帮助他们找到有趣的故事。而且你更有可能从你帮助过的创业者那里获得线索。所以，如果你有兴趣了解更多关于媒体报道的信息，这里有两个我真的很喜欢的资源。杰森·金凯德曾是 TechCrunch 的记者，他写了一本非常棒的概述，更深入地涵盖了我刚才谈到的很多内容，而且是从博主的角度。那是一本非常棒的书。另一个有点邪恶的资源是这本《相信我，我在撒谎》，由美国服饰公司前营销人员之一撰写。他谈到了很多他实际上相当邪恶地操纵媒体的方法，但我认为这本书很好地揭示了事物如何在互联网上传播的心理，故事如何在互联网上传播。可能值得一看。好的，基本上就是这样。

When is the right time to start worrying about press altogether? I think it's a really good way. The first time I launched my first products in our first startup, for a lot of them we got like zero attention. And we didn't really know how to even get a hundred users. I think it's a really fine way to get a hundred users and a lot of companies in YC where they first launch their product will encourage them to get out and just do one TechCrunch story to get a few people to see it, and it's good to get in the practice. I wouldn't obsess over getting coverage in multiple outlets or anything like that in the very beginning.

什么时候才是开始关注媒体报道的合适时机？我认为这是一个很好的方式。当我第一次在我们的初创公司推出我的第一个产品时，很多产品几乎无人关注。我们甚至不知道如何获得一百个用户。我认为这是一个很好的方式来获得一百个用户，很多 YC 公司在首次推出产品时会鼓励他们走出去，只做一篇 TechCrunch 报道，让一些人看到它，这是很好的练习。我不会在最初阶段就执着于在多个媒体渠道获得报道或类似的事情。

The other thing is, we didn't come up with the idea for Twitch, right? That was actually fortuitous. But we helped give it legs by making the company available to talk to reporters, and suggesting follow-up stories.
另一件事是，我们并没有想出 Twitch 这个主意，对吧？那其实是偶然的。但我们通过让公司愿意与记者交谈，并建议后续报道来帮助推动它。

You know, there were stories not just about Twitch Plays Pokemon because a hundred thousand people were watching this Pokemon game, but also stories when they beat the game. And there were stories when they launched Twitch Plays Pokemon Crystal, or whatever the next Pokemon version was. So we kind of gave that story a little more legs. But we didn't originate it. It was really the community who originated it.
你知道，之所以有报道不仅仅是因为有十万人观看这个 Pokemon 游戏，还因为当他们通关游戏时有报道。当他们推出 Twitch Plays Pokemon Crystal 或任何下一个 Pokemon 版本时也有报道。所以我们算是给那个故事增添了一些延续性。但我们并没有创造它。真正创造它的是社区。

All right. I think that's it. Thank you very much.
好的。我想就是这样。非常感谢。
