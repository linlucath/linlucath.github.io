All right. So when I talk about making products users love, what I mean specifically is how do we make things that have a passionate user base that our users are unconditionally wanting to be successful, both on the products that we build but also the companies behind them. We're gonna go over tons of information. Try not to take too many notes, mostly just try to listen. I'll post the link to the slides on my Twitter account, and on that link, there will be a way for you to annotate the slide and you can ask me questions. And so if we don't get to them, I'll answer them after the talk.

好的。当我谈到打造用户喜爱的产品时，我具体指的是我们如何创造出拥有热情用户群体的产品，让我们的用户无条件地希望这些产品能够成功，不仅是我们打造的产品本身，还包括它们背后的公司。我们将要讨论大量信息。尽量不要做太多笔记，主要就是认真听讲。我会在我的推特账号上发布幻灯片链接，通过这个链接，你们可以给幻灯片添加注释并提出问题。如果我们没有来得及回答，我会在演讲结束后进行回复。

So, you guys have been listening to and hearing a lot about growth over the last several weeks, and to me I feel like growth is usually fairly simple. It's the interaction between two sort of concepts or variables: conversion rate and churn. Right? And the gap between those two things pretty much indicate how fast you're gonna grow. And most people, especially business type people, tend to look at this interaction in terms of a very calculated in a mathematical sort of way.

所以，在过去的几周里，你们已经听了很多关于增长的内容，对我来说，增长通常相当简单。它是两种概念或变量之间的相互作用：转化率和流失率。对吧？这两者之间的差距基本上决定了你的增长速度。大多数人，特别是商业人士，倾向于以非常计算化的数学方式来看待这种相互作用。

And today, I sort of want to talk about these things at a more human scale. All right, because at startup when you're interacting with your users, you have a fairly intimate interaction that you have in the early stages. And so, I think there's a different way of looking at this stuff in terms of how we build our products. And we'll look at a lot of different examples of that and how it's executed well.

而今天，我想从更人性化的角度来讨论这些问题。好的，因为在初创阶段，当你与用户互动时，你们在早期阶段有着相当密切的互动。因此，我认为在构建产品的方式上，看待这些事情有一种不同的视角。我们将看到很多不同的例子，以及如何很好地执行这些理念。

My philosophy behind a lot of things that I teach startups is the best way to get to a billion dollars is to focus on the values that help you get that first dollar, to acquire that first user. If you get that right everything else will take care of itself. It's a sort of faith thing. So I came to be a partner at YC by way of being alumni. I went to the program in winter of 2006, so it's the second ever program and I built a product called Wufoo. Wufoo's an online forum builder. It helps you create contact forums and online surveys and simple payment forms. It's basically a database that looks like it's designed by Fisher Price. What's interesting, though, is that because it was fairly easy to use, we had customers from every industry, market, and vertical you can think of, including a majority of the Fortune 500 companies out there. We ran the company for five years, and then we were acquired by SurveyMonkey in 2013. And at the time, we were a very interesting acquisition. We were only a team of ten people at the time. And, while we acquired funding out here in Silicon Valley through Y Combinator we actually ran the company from Florida. We had no office. Everyone worked from home. And we're an interesting outlier. So, each dot here represents a startup that exited through IPO or acquisition. And we're this outlier to the left. The bottom is the funding amount they took. And the vertical axis is the valuation of the company at the time.

我向初创企业传授的核心理念是：实现十亿美元估值的最佳方式，就是专注于那些帮你赚到第一美元、获取第一个用户的价值理念。如果你能做好这一点，其他一切都会水到渠成。这有点像信念的力量。我之所以成为YC的合伙人，是因为我曾是校友。我参加了2006年冬季的项目，那是第二届项目，当时我开发了一款名为Wufoo的产品。Wufoo是一个在线表单构建工具，能帮助用户创建联系表单、在线调查和简易支付表单。它本质上是一个看起来像费雪玩具设计的数据库。但有趣的是，由于它非常易于使用，我们拥有来自你能想到的所有行业、市场和垂直领域的客户，包括大多数财富500强企业。我们运营这家公司五年后，于2013年被SurveyMonkey收购。当时我们是个很有意思的收购案例：团队仅有十人，虽然通过Y Combinator在硅谷获得了融资，但实际公司在佛罗里达州运营。我们没有办公室，全员远程办公，这使我们成为一个特殊的异常值。这里的每个圆点代表通过IPO或被收购退出的初创企业，而我们是左侧这个异常值。横轴显示它们获得的融资金额，纵轴则是公司当时的估值。

To sum it up, the average startup rates as about $25 million. And they return to their

Wufoo raised about $118 thousand total, and our return to our investors is about 29,000%. So a lot of people were very interested and are sort of like, what makes Wufoo a little bit different or how do we run the company very differently? A lot of it was focused on product. We weren't interested in building software that just people wanted to use. We wanted a product that people wanted to love, that people wanted to have a relationship with, and we were actually very fanatical about how we approached this idea at the point where it's almost sort of sciency sort of way.

So what we said was like, okay, what's interesting about start-ups in terms of us wanting to create things that people love is that love and unconditional sort of feelings are things that are difficult for us to do in sort of real life. And at start-ups we have to do it sort of at scale. So we've decided to do is just start by just looking at, okay, how does real relationships work in the real world, and how can we apply them to sort of how we run our business and sort of build our product that way. So we'll go over basically these two metaphors, find new users as if we're trying to date them and existing users as if it were a successful marriage. So when it comes to dating, lot of the stuff that we uncovered had to do with first impressions. All of you often talk about your relationships in terms of the origin story.

Wufoo总共募集了约11.8万美元，而我们的投资回报率约为29,000%。因此很多人都非常感兴趣，想知道是什么让Wufoo有所不同，或者我们如何以截然不同的方式运营公司？这很大程度上聚焦于产品。我们不想开发那种人们只是勉强想用的软件，我们想要的是人们愿意热爱、愿意建立情感联系的产品。实际上我们对此理念的追求近乎狂热，甚至带着科学方法论般的严谨。

所以我们思考的是：初创公司想要创造人们热爱的事物，其有趣之处在于，爱与无条件的情感在现实生活中往往难以实现。而在初创公司中，我们却需要大规模地实现这种情感连接。因此我们决定从观察现实世界中的真实关系如何运作开始，探索如何将这种关系模式应用到企业运营和产品构建中。我们将通过两个基本比喻展开：寻找新用户就像尝试约会，维护现有用户则如同经营成功婚姻。在约会方面，我们发现诸多要素都与第一印象相关。大家讲述自己的关系时，往往都会追溯到最初相识的故事。

If I asked you to tell me about the first kiss, how you sort of met, how you proposed, these are the things that we say over and over and over again. They're basically the word-of-mouth stories of our relationships, and they're the same kinds of things that we do with companies. Human beings are relationship manufacturing creatures. We cannot help but create and anthropomorphize the things we interact with over and over again. So, whether it's the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the tools and software we use, we eventually prescribe characteristics to it. A personality. And we expect it to behave a certain way. And that's how we sort of interact with it. Now first impressions are important for the starting of any relationship, because it's the one we tell over and over again. Right? And there's something special about how we regard that origin story. I'll give an example. If you're on a first date with somebody, and you're having a nice dinner, and you catch them picking their nose. You are probably not gonna have another date with them. Right, but if you're married to someone for about 20 to 30 years, and you catch them on the Barca Lounger digging for gold, right? You don't immediately call your lawyer and say we have a problem here. I need to start drawing up papers for divorce. You shrug your shoulders and say at least he has a heart of gold.

如果我让你讲述初吻的经历，你们如何相遇，如何求婚，这些都是我们反复讲述的事情。它们基本上是我们恋爱关系的口碑故事，也是我们对公司所做的同类事情。人类是制造关系的生物。我们情不自禁地反复创造并赋予我们互动的事物以人性化特征。所以，无论是我们驾驶的汽车、穿着的衣服、使用的工具和软件，我们最终都会赋予它们特性。一种个性。我们期望它以某种方式行事。这就是我们与之互动的方式。第一印象对于任何关系的开始都很重要，因为这是我们反复讲述的那一个。对吧？我们对这个起源故事的看待方式有些特别。我来举个例子。如果你和某人第一次约会，正在享用美好的晚餐，却发现他们在挖鼻孔。你可能不会再和他们约会了。但是，如果你和某人结婚大约20到30年，发现他们在躺椅上挖鼻孔，对吧？你不会立即打电话给律师说我们有问题了，我需要开始起草离婚文件。你耸耸肩说至少他有一颗金子般的心。

Investors about 676% so much lower in terms of pass fail. So, in software, and for most products in internet software that we use, first impressions are pretty obvious. And they're the things that you see a lot of companies sort of pay attention to in terms of what they send their marketing people to work on. My argument for people who are very good at product is they discover so many other first moments, and they make those something memorable. Right, the first email you ever get from a piece of software. What happens when you first log in? The links, the advertising, the very first time you interact with customer support. All of those are opportunities to seduce.

投资者的通过失败率约为676%，要低得多。因此，在我们使用的软件和大多数互联网软件产品中，第一印象是非常明显的。你会看到很多公司都在关注这些方面，并让他们的营销人员去处理。我认为，对于擅长产品的人来说，他们会发现许多其他的初次接触时刻，并让这些时刻变得令人难忘。比如，你从某个软件收到的第一封邮件。当你首次登录时会发生什么？链接、广告、你第一次与客户支持互动的时候。所有这些都蕴含着吸引用户的机会。

So how did we think about it? It has a dinosaur on it, which I think is awesome. But if you hover over it, the spec has the added benefit of having a tool tip that doesn't explain how to login or what it does, but basically, rawr. What we noticed about this in early usability studies is that this put a smile on people's faces. Hands down, universally. And I think a lot of times when we are assessing products, we never think about what is the emotion on the person's face when they interact with this?

那么我们是怎样考虑的呢？它上面有一只恐龙，我觉得这很棒。但当你悬停在上面时，这个规格的额外好处是有一个工具提示，它不解释如何登录或它的功能，而是基本上写着"嗷呜"。我们在早期可用性研究中注意到，这会让人们脸上露出笑容。毫无疑问，普遍如此。我认为很多时候当我们评估产品时，我们从未想过当人们与这个产品互动时，他们脸上的表情是什么？

This is Vimeo's login page from a couple iterations ago. It's one I find to be the most beautiful. It lets you know that when you're starting out on this journey with Vimeo, that this is gonna be something different. They do this all over the app. If you search for the word "fart", as you scroll up and down it makes fart noises as you do this. There's something different, like this site interacts with you.

这是Vimeo几代版本前的登录页面。这是我认为最漂亮的版本。它让你知道当你开始与Vimeo的这段旅程时，这将是一次与众不同的体验。他们在整个应用程序中都这样做。如果你搜索"放屁"这个词，当你上下滚动时，它会发出放屁的声音。这里有些不同之处，就像这个网站与你互动一样。

It's a little bit magical, it's a little bit different. And it's something that you wanna talk about. You don't have to always do it with design. This is a sign up form for Cork, which used to be a social network for people who loved to drink wine. On it, it says email address, it's also your sign-in and has to be legit. First name, what your mom calls you. Last name, what your Army buddies call you. Password, something you'll remember.

它有点神奇，有点与众不同。这是你会想要谈论的事情。你不必总是通过设计来实现这一点。这是Cork的注册表格，它曾经是一个为喜爱品酒的人设立的社交网络。上面写着电子邮件地址，这也是你的登录名，必须是有效的。名字，你妈妈怎么称呼你。姓氏，你的军中伙伴怎么称呼你。密码，你会记住的东西。

So how did we think about password confirmation? Remember, but hard to guess. Think of it as a test. It's literally a poem as you fill out the form. Right? And this is the kind of thing where you think, "Oh, I like the people behind this. I'm gonna enjoy this experience." Now what does it say when you fill out a form like this? On Yahoo, about what the personality of the site is going to be. And what's disappointing to me is that Yahoo forces every product and service under them to use this exact same login form. Flickr, I had thought, had one of the best calls to action. It was "get in there". This is Heroku's sign up page. I think this is an older version. But what's remarkable about it is that you start getting a feel for scaling up. My sort of server and back end services is as easy as dragging up and down different knobs and levers. It's gonna be beautifully used, and it looks fairly easy to scale. Since we're in a room full of computer science people, I think you'll appreciate this. This is Chocolat. This is a code editor, and they only have one call to action. When the time limit is up, they say everything in terms of all the pieces are exactly the same except we change the font to Comic Sans. And what they're basically saying is, "Hey, we know who our users are, who our real customers are." They're gonna be the people who care about this. This is Hurl.

那么我们应该如何看待密码确认？要容易记住但难以猜测。把它看作一个测试。当你填写表格时，这简直就像一首诗。对吧？这正是那种让你觉得"我喜欢背后设计这些的人，我会享受这种体验"的东西。当你填写这样的表格时，它说明了什么？在雅虎上，这说明了网站将具有什么样的个性。令我失望的是，雅虎强制其下的所有产品和服务都使用完全相同的登录表单。我曾以为Flickr拥有最佳的行动号召之一，就是"立即加入"。这是Heroku的注册页面，我认为这是一个较旧的版本。但它的非凡之处在于，你开始感受到扩展的感觉。我的服务器和后端服务就像上下拖动不同的旋钮和杠杆一样简单。它将被很好地使用，而且看起来相当容易扩展。既然我们身处满是计算机科学人士的房间，我想你们会欣赏这个。这是Chocolat，一个代码编辑器，他们只有一个行动号召。当时间限制到了，他们说除了我们把字体改为Comic Sans之外，所有部分都完全一样。他们基本上是在说："嘿，我们知道我们的用户是谁，我们真正的客户是谁。"他们将是关心这一点的人。这是Hurl。

This is Hurl, a website for checking HTTP requests. Sometimes the places where you get errors are opportunities for first moments. You had a four of four, this is what you get. When we need help, oftentimes what we do is create really beautiful marketing materials. But when you actually need documentation, we sort of skimp out on design features. This is a point that you see happen over and again. A company that gets this right is MailChimp. What they did was redesign all of their help guides so that they looked like magazine covers. Overnight, basically, readership goes up on all these features, and customer support for things that help people optimize emails goes down.

这是Hurl，一个用于检查HTTP请求的网站。有时出现错误的地方正是创造初次体验的机会。你获得了满分，这就是你应得的。当我们寻求帮助时，通常我们会制作精美的营销材料。但当你真正需要文档时，我们却会在设计功能上有所保留。这一点你会反复看到。在这方面做得很好的公司是MailChimp。他们重新设计了所有帮助指南，使其看起来像杂志封面。基本上在一夜之间，所有这些功能的阅读量都上升了，而帮助人们优化邮件的客户支持需求则下降了。

Speaking of documentation, Stripe. What's interesting about an API company is that there is no UX. The UX is actually just documentation, right? There are opportunities even in documentation to enchant and amaze. One of the things that I love about them is their examples are wonderful. But if you're actually logging into the app, one of the things that is a super pain for most people when dealing with most APIs is grabbing your API credentials and keys. What Stripe does is it says, if you're logged into the app, we automatically put your API credentials into the examples, so you only have to copy paste once when trying to learn their API.

说到文档，Stripe。一个API公司有趣的地方在于没有用户体验设计。用户体验实际上就是文档，对吧？即使在文档中也有让人着迷和惊叹的机会。我喜欢他们的一点是他们的示例非常出色。但如果你实际登录应用程序，处理大多数API时最让人头疼的事情之一就是获取API凭证和密钥。Stripe的做法是，如果你登录了应用程序，我们会自动将你的API凭证填入示例中，这样你在学习他们的API时只需复制粘贴一次。

When Wufoo wanted to launch the third version of our API, we realized that this was finally good enough for people to build on top of it. We were trying to figure out how to launch this to the world in a way that reflected our personality. Many companies typically hold programming API contests and give out iPads and iPhones, which makes them look like everyone else. In our company, one unique value we have is that the co-founders are big medieval enthusiasts. We take everyone out to Medieval Times every single year on the anniversary of the company's founding. So we decided to do something in that flavor. We contacted the guys at armor.com and asked if they could forward us a custom battle-ax. We announced that if you won our programming contest, you would win one. The result was that people wanted to talk about this. It was something people wanted to work on because they wanted to be able to say they were programming for a weapon. What's cool is we had over 25 different applications created for us, with quality and quantity that we could not have paid for given our budget and the time we had for this. We got things like an iPhone app, Android app, and WordPress plugins. All because we changed how people wanted to talk about the origin story of how they were interacting with one of our services.

当Wufoo想要推出我们API的第三个版本时，我们意识到这终于足够完善，可以让人们在此基础上进行开发。我们试图找出一种能够体现我们个性的方式来向世界发布这个产品。许多公司通常会举办编程API竞赛，并赠送iPad和iPhone作为奖品，这让它们看起来和其他公司没什么区别。在我们公司，一个独特的价值观是我们的联合创始人是中世纪文化的狂热爱好者。每年在公司成立纪念日，我们都会带所有人去中世纪主题餐厅。因此我们决定做一些符合这种风格的事情。我们联系了armor.com的工作人员，询问他们是否能给我们寄送一把定制战斧。我们宣布，如果你赢得了我们的编程竞赛，你就能获得一把。结果是人们都想要谈论这件事。这是人们愿意投入工作的项目，因为他们想要能够说自己是在为一件武器编程。最酷的是，我们获得了超过25个不同应用程序，其质量和数量都是在我们有限的预算和时间内无法用金钱买到的。我们获得了诸如iPhone应用、Android应用和WordPress插件等成果。这一切都是因为我们改变了人们想要讲述他们如何与我们服务互动的起源故事的方式。

And go like all day long of going over these examples. That's just doing it right. That shows that they're being conscientious of the user and the customers. When it comes to long term relationships or marriages, the only research that we ended up having to read was the stuff that was done by John Gottman. He's been featured in This American Life, in Malcolm Gladwell's books. He's a marriage researcher up in Seattle. And he has an interesting parlor trick that he can do. He can watch a video tape of a couple fighting about some issue for 15 minutes and predict with an 85% accuracy rate whether that couple will be together or not, or divorced in four years. If he increases that video up to an hour and asks them to also talk about their hopes and dreams, that prediction rating goes up to 94%. They showed these same video tapes to marriage counselors, successfully married couples, sociologists, psychiatrists, priests, et cetera and they can't predict with random chance whether people are gonna be together or not. So John Gottman understands something fundamental about how relationships work in the long term. And that basically how we fight, even in a short term period can indicate sort of the whole system and what it's gonna look like. And one of the surprising things he discovered, it's not that successfully married people don't fight at all. It turns out everybody fights. And we all fight about the exact same things: money, kids, sex, time and others. And others are things like jealousy and in-laws.

整天都在反复研究这些例子。这样做才是正确的。这表明他们对用户和客户都很负责。当涉及到长期关系或婚姻时，我们最终必须阅读的唯一研究就是约翰·戈特曼所做的那些。他曾在《美国生活》节目和马尔科姆·格拉德威尔的书中被特别介绍。他是西雅图的一位婚姻研究员。他有一个有趣的拿手好戏。他可以观看一对夫妇就某个问题争吵15分钟的录像带，并以85%的准确率预测这对夫妇四年后是否还会在一起，或者是否会离婚。如果他将录像时间增加到一小时，并让他们谈论自己的希望和梦想，这个预测准确率会上升到94%。他们向婚姻顾问、成功婚姻的夫妇、社会学家、精神病学家、牧师等人展示了这些相同的录像带，但他们无法以随机概率预测人们是否会在一起。所以约翰·戈特曼对长期关系如何运作有着根本性的理解。基本上，我们如何争吵，即使在短期内，也能反映出整个系统的状况及其未来走向。他发现的令人惊讶的事情之一是，并不是成功婚姻的人完全不吵架。事实证明每个人都会吵架。我们都为完全相同的事情争吵：金钱、孩子、性、时间和其他问题。其他问题还包括嫉妒和姻亲关系。

To bring this around, you can actually attribute every single one of these to problems that you see in customer support when you're building out your products. This costs too much. I'm having problems with a credit card. If you're building a service that helps people deal with their clients, they're very sensitive about anything happening with that. Performance: how long you're up and how fast. Others are jealousy and in-laws, which is competition and partnerships. So anything weird happening there, people are gonna write to you about. And the reason I like to think about this in terms of customer support is that in every process of a conversion funnel, customer support is the thing that happens in between every one of these steps. It's the reason why people don't make it further down there. It's the thing that prevents conversion from happening. Now, as we were thinking through all these ideas and as we were building up the company, we realized that there's a big problem about how everyone sort of starts their company or builds up their engineering teams. And that is that there's a broken feedback loop there. People are divorced from the consequences of their actions. And this is the result of the natural evolution of how most companies get founded, especially by technical co-founders. Before launch it is a time of bliss, nirvana, and opportunity. Nothing that you do is wrong. By your hand, which you feel is like god, everything that you write, every line of code feels perfect and is ingenious to you.

总而言之，你可以将所有这些都归因于你在开发产品时在客户支持中看到的问题。这太贵了。我的信用卡出了问题。如果你正在构建一个帮助人们处理客户关系的服务，他们对其中的任何问题都非常敏感。性能：你的系统运行时间和速度。其他方面包括嫉妒和姻亲关系，也就是竞争和合作关系。所以任何奇怪的事情发生，人们都会写信告诉你。我喜欢从客户支持的角度来思考这个问题的原因是，在转化漏斗的每一个环节中，客户支持都发生在这些步骤之间。这就是人们无法进一步推进的原因。它是阻止转化发生的关键。现在，当我们思考所有这些想法并建立公司时，我们意识到每个人如何开始他们的公司或建立工程团队存在一个大问题。那就是存在一个断裂的反馈循环。人们与自身行为的后果脱节。这实际上是大多数公司成立方式自然演变的结果，特别是由技术联合创始人创立的公司。在发布之前，这是一个充满幸福、涅槃和机遇的时期。你所做的一切都不会错。通过你感觉像上帝之手，你写的每一行代码都感觉完美，对你来说都是天才之作。

When you're launching, the thing that happens is after launch reality sets in, and then all these other tasks come into place that we have to deal with. Now what technical co-founders want to do is get back to that initial state. What we often see is that companies start siloing off all these other things that actually make a startup or a company real, and have other people do them. In our minds, these other tasks are inferior, and we have other people in the company do them. For us, what we're trying to figure out is how do we change software development so that we inject some values that we don't talk about enough: responsibility, accountability, humility, modesty. We called this, like a lot of other people, we had an acronym: Support Driven Development. It's very similar to TDD or other agile practices. It's a way of creating high quality software, but it's super simple. You don't need SCRUM, you don't need a bunch of post-it notes. All you have to do is make everyone do customer support. What you end up having is you fix the feedback loop. The people who build the software are the ones supporting it, and you get all these nice benefits as a result. One of them is support responsible developers and designers and people who build the stuff give the very best support. We're not the first person to think of this. Paul English was a big proponent of this at Kayak, and what he did was install a red customer support phone.

当你进行产品发布时，实际情况是发布后现实开始显现，然后所有这些其他任务就会出现，我们必须处理它们。技术联合创始人想要做的是回到最初的状态。我们经常看到的是，公司开始将这些实际上让初创公司或公司变得真实的其他事务隔离出去，并让其他人来处理。在我们看来，这些其他任务是次要的，我们让公司里的其他人来做这些事。对我们来说，我们正在努力弄清楚的是如何改变软件开发，以便注入一些我们谈论不足的价值观：责任感、问责制、谦逊、谦虚。像其他许多人一样，我们为此创造了一个缩写：支持驱动开发。它与测试驱动开发或其他敏捷实践非常相似。这是一种创建高质量软件的方法，但非常简单。你不需要SCRUM，不需要一堆便利贴。你只需要让每个人都做客户支持。最终你会修复反馈循环。构建软件的人就是支持它的人，因此你会获得所有这些好处。其中之一是，负责支持的开发人员、设计师和产品构建者会提供最好的支持。我们不是第一个想到这一点的人。保罗·英格利希在Kayak大力提倡这一点，他所做的是安装了一部红色的客户支持电话。

When you're on the engineering floor, the thing that happens is a line in the middle. They were just regular customer support calls. People would often ask him why you would pay engineers $120,000 or more to do something that you can pay other people a fraction of to handle in a call center. He says, well, after the second or third time that phone rings and the engineer gets the same problem, they stop what they're doing, they fix the bug, and we stop getting phone calls about it. It's a way of having QA in a sort of nice elegant solution.

在工程部门工作时，中间会出现一条电话线路。这些只是普通的客户支持电话。人们经常问他，为什么要支付工程师12万美元或更多来做那些只需支付一小部分费用就能在呼叫中心处理的事情。他说，当电话响了两三次，工程师遇到同样的问题时，他们会停下手中的工作，修复这个错误，我们就不再接到关于这个问题的电话了。这是一种通过优雅解决方案实现质量保证的方式。

Now, John Gottman talks about the reason that we often break up with one another as due to four major causes and their warning signs. He calls them the four horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. Criticism is basically people starting to focus not just on the specific issue at hand, but on the overarching issues. Like, you never listen to your users or you never think about us all the time. Contempt is when someone is purposely trying to insult somebody. Defensiveness is not trying to take accountability, trying to make excuses for the actions. And stonewalling is basically shutting down. Stonewalling, to John Gottman, is one of the worst things that we can do in a relationship.

现在，约翰·戈特曼谈到我们经常分手的原因归结为四个主要原因及其预警信号。他称之为四骑士：批评、蔑视、防御和石墙。批评基本上是人们开始不仅关注手头的具体问题，还关注更广泛的问题。比如，你从不听取用户的意见，或者你从不考虑我们。蔑视是当有人故意试图侮辱别人时。防御是不愿承担责任，试图为自己的行为找借口。而石墙基本上是关闭沟通。对约翰·戈特曼来说，石墙是我们在关系中能做的最糟糕的事情之一。

Hold up. And oftentimes, we don't worry much about this in customer service: criticism and contempt. Right? Defensiveness, you see this all the time in companies, especially as they get older. But stonewalling, this is something I see happen with start-ups all the time. You get a bunch of customer support requests coming in and you just think I don't need to answer it. I don't need to respond. Right? And that act of just not even getting back to them is one of the worst things you can do. And it's probably some of the biggest causes of churn in the early stages of start-ups.

等一下。很多时候，我们在客户服务中不太担心这些：批评和蔑视。对吧？防御心理，你在公司里经常看到这种情况，尤其是随着公司发展壮大。但是回避沟通，这是我经常在初创公司看到的现象。你收到一大堆客户支持请求，然后你就想我不需要回复。我不需要回应。对吧？而这种甚至不回复他们的行为，是你能做的最糟糕的事情之一。这很可能就是初创公司早期客户流失的最大原因之一。

This is how support worked out with Wufoo. When we were acquired we had about 500,000 users on the system, 5 million people used Wufoo forms and reports, whether they knew it or not, and all those people got support from the same ten people, and usually it was only one person dedicated support a day, or any shift. Results in about 400 issues a week. That's about 800 emails. But a response time from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. was between seven to 12 minutes. Right? And from 9 p.m. to midnight it was an hour. And on the weekend it would be no longer than 24 hours. And we carried this up all the way up to the scale.

这就是Wufoo的客服运作方式。当我们被收购时，系统上大约有50万用户，500万人使用Wufoo表单和报告，不管他们是否知道这一点，所有这些人都由相同的十个人提供支持，通常每天或每个班次只有一个人专门负责支持。每周大约处理400个问题。这大约是800封邮件。但是从上午9点到晚上9点的响应时间在7到12分钟之间。对吧？从晚上9点到午夜是一个小时。周末不会超过24小时。我们一直将这种服务水平保持到规模化阶段。

What a lot of people forget about, and often talk about with Airbnb, is how they did this interesting thing where they had went up to New York and offered professional photographers, and the founders would go out there and actually take pictures of the people's apartments to help them sell more. Focusing on the stories around conversion. What most people don't realize is a lot of times when I saw Joe in the early days of Airbnb, he had a phone headset stuck to his head all the time.

很多人忘记但经常谈论Airbnb的是，他们做了这件有趣的事情，他们去了纽约并提供专业摄影师服务，创始人会亲自去那里为人们的公寓拍照，帮助他们销售更多。关注的是关于转化的故事。大多数人没有意识到的是，在Airbnb早期我经常看到Joe时，他总是戴着电话耳机。

Churn is a story we don't like to talk about often. Airbnb's growth really started picking up once they figured out how to match capacity to the demand, or the phone calls that they were getting into their support system. At Wufoo we actually constantly did experiments around support, because we're so obsessed with it. One experiment we did was, we heard Kathy Sierra do a talk about there's a disconnect between the motions that we have when we need help, and the content and the reactions we get from people when we get help from them, especially online. Because they just don't see all those nonverbal cues. So she said unless there's face recognition on the web, we're just always going to be disconnected from our users. Our feeling was, like, well we're not face recognition experts but I think there's another way of getting empathy. So, as form builders, we added a drop-down and what we said was like, hey, what's your emotional state? And our hypothesis was that no one was gonna fill this out. We basically thought, oh okay, you know what, this is gonna be pretty a lame experiment, but we'll see how it sort of goes. And it turned out the Emotional State drop-down field was filled out 75.8% of the time. The browser type drop-down filled just in comparison was filled out 78.1% of the time. So people were basically telling us, for my technical support issue how I feel about this problem is just as important as all the technical details you need to sorta figure out how to debug it.

流失率是我们不愿经常谈论的话题。Airbnb的增长真正开始加速是在他们弄清楚如何将容量与需求相匹配，或者说是与他们支持系统接到的电话量相匹配之后。在Wufoo，我们实际上不断围绕客户支持进行实验，因为我们对此非常着迷。我们做的一个实验是，我们听了Kathy Sierra的演讲，谈到当我们需要帮助时的动作与我们获得帮助时从他人那里得到的内容和反应之间存在脱节，尤其是在线帮助。因为他们看不到所有那些非语言线索。所以她说除非网络上有面部识别，否则我们将始终与用户脱节。我们的感觉是，虽然我们不是面部识别专家，但我认为还有另一种获得同理心的方式。因此，作为表单构建者，我们添加了一个下拉菜单，我们问的是：嘿，你的情绪状态如何？我们的假设是没有人会填写这个。我们基本上认为，好吧，这将是一个相当蹩脚的实验，但我们会看看结果如何。结果发现情绪状态下拉字段的填写率为75.8%。相比之下，浏览器类型下拉字段的填写率为78.1%。所以人们基本上在告诉我们，对于我的技术支持问题，我对这个问题的感受与你需要用来调试的所有技术细节同样重要。

All the time, because he was... Now we didn't prioritize things or triage things by emotion, right? And for the most part, people didn't game the system. One of the interesting byproducts was that we noticed people started being nicer to us in customer support. It was something sort of subconscious. We just were thinking like, wow, users are so much better now. What's going on? We went back and looked at the data, did some text analysis, and realized that when it comes to only communicating with people over written words like email, there are only three ways that you show strong emotions: exclamation marks, curse words, and all caps. Sure enough, on all three of those metrics, they've gone down in the way people were talking to us in customer support. Once people had a simple outlet for their emotions, they would be a lot more rational, and it made our jobs much more pleasant as a result. The other awesome byproduct is that you actually build better software when you do this - far better software. This is actually backed up by tons of research. Jared Spool, a user interface engineer who is one of the big players in this space, says there's a direct correlation between how much time we spend directly exposed to users and how good our designs get. He says it has to come in this specific way - it has to be direct exposure. It can't be something where someone generates a report or through a graph; you have to be interacting with them somewhat real time.

一直以来，因为他总是...现在我们不再根据情绪来优先处理或分类事务，对吧？而且在大多数情况下，人们不会钻系统空子。其中一个有趣的副产品是，我们注意到客户支持中人们开始对我们更加友善。这有点像是潜意识的行为。我们当时在想，哇，现在的用户好多了。这是怎么回事？我们回头查看了数据，进行了一些文本分析，然后意识到当仅通过书面文字（如电子邮件）与人交流时，只有三种方式可以表达强烈情绪：感叹号、脏话和全大写。果然，在客户支持中人们与我们交谈的方式上，这三项指标都下降了。一旦人们有了简单的情绪宣泄渠道，他们就会变得更加理性，结果也让我们的工作愉快多了。另一个很棒的副产品是，当你这样做时，实际上能构建更好的软件——好得多的软件。这实际上得到了大量研究的支持。用户界面工程师贾里德·斯普尔是这个领域的重要人物之一，他表示我们直接接触用户的时间与设计质量提升之间存在直接关联。他说必须通过这种特定方式实现——必须是直接接触。不能是通过某人生成报告或通过图表的方式；你必须以近乎实时的方式与他们互动。

It has to be a minimum of every six weeks, and it has to be for at least two hours. Otherwise your software will get worse over time. Our developers, our people who are on Wufoo were getting exposed to our users four to eight hours every single week. And what it does is it changes the way you sort of build software.

必须至少每六周一次，且每次至少持续两小时。否则你的软件会随着时间推移变得越来越差。我们的开发人员，那些在Wufoo工作的人员，每周都会接触我们的用户四到八小时。这样做会改变你构建软件的方式。

Jared Spool has another way of talking about how we build products. Let's imagine that this represents all the knowledge needed to sort of use your app on a spectrum. This is like no knowledge, and this is all the knowledge needed. These two lines are pretty much your interactions with users what you're trying to get them to. This is currently where their knowledge point is and this is the target knowledge point that you're trying to get them to, to understand that to use your app.

Jared Spool有另一种方式来讨论我们如何构建产品。让我们想象这代表了在某个范围内使用你的应用所需的所有知识。这就像零知识，而这则是所需的所有知识。这两条线基本上就是你与用户的互动，你试图让他们达到的目标。这是他们当前的知识水平，而这是你试图让他们达到的目标知识水平，以便理解并使用你的应用。

The gap between those is called the knowledge gap, Jared Spool called it. And what's interesting about this is there's only two ways to sort of fix this. That gap represents how intuitive your app is. You either get the user to increase their knowledge or you decrease the amount of knowledge that's needed to use your application.

这两者之间的差距被称为知识差距，Jared Spool这样称呼它。有趣的是，只有两种方法来解决这个问题。这个差距代表了你的应用有多直观。你要么让用户增加他们的知识，要么减少使用你的应用所需的知识量。

And oftentimes, as engineers and people who build and work on products, we think let's add new features. And new features only means let's increase the knowledge gap. So for us we actually focused a lot on the other sort of direction.

通常，作为工程师和构建产品的工作人员，我们会想：让我们添加新功能。而新功能只意味着让我们增加知识差距。因此对我们来说，我们实际上更多地关注另一个方向。

All the time, because he spent a lot of time, 30% of our engineering time was spent on internal tools to help with our customer support stuff. But oftentimes it was spent helping people help themselves. Things like frequently asked questions, tool tips. Things like, if you just click the help link, instead of taking you to the generic help documentation page, you go to the specific page that is going to be most appropriate for what you're working on. We redesigned our documentation over and over again, AB tested it constantly. One iteration of our documentation reduced customer support by 30% overnight. It's one of those things where, overnight, all the people that work on the product immediately had 30% less work to do.

一直以来，因为他花费了大量时间，我们30%的工程时间都用于开发内部工具来协助客户支持工作。但很多时候这些工具是为了帮助用户自助解决问题。比如常见问题解答、工具提示等功能。比如说，当你点击帮助链接时，不是跳转到通用的帮助文档页面，而是直接进入与你当前工作内容最相关的特定页面。我们反复重新设计文档系统，持续进行AB测试。有一次文档更新在一夜之间就将客户支持工作量减少了30%。这就是那种能让产品团队的工作量瞬间减少30%的典型案例。

Now what happens if you have everyone work on customer support constantly, and thinking about it in terms of a remarkable way? Well, I talked a lot about, in the very beginning growth is a function of conversion and churn. This is Wufoo's growth curve for the first five years. What's interesting is that we paid no money on advertising, on marketing. All of it was done by word of mouth growth. And the interaction between new users and downgrades are this. It's so slight what it takes, that gap, making that sort of work. And what a lot of people keep forgetting is that there's almost no difference between an increase in conversion rate, 1% increase and a 1% decrease churn.

如果你让所有人都持续参与客户支持工作，并以卓越的方式思考这个问题，会发生什么？我在最开始就多次谈到，增长是转化率和流失率的函数。这是Wufoo前五年的增长曲线。有趣的是，我们没有在广告和营销上投入任何资金。所有增长都来自口碑传播。新用户与降级用户之间的互动关系就是如此。实现这种效果所需的差距微乎其微。很多人一直忽略的是，转化率提高1%与流失率降低1%之间几乎没有差别。

They do exactly the same thing to your growth. However, the ladder is actually much easier to do. It's much cheaper to do in your apps, and a lot of the times we neglect this way too far along. Right? And we usually have our B team works on these sort of projects and services. This is actually not the graph that we track most of the time at Wufoo, it's not even the one I'm proud of. This is the one I'm proud of. Because even though we have this sort of nice, awesome curve of growth, this is what, how loud is this scale? Keep the company small, have an awesome culture. And that required doing a lot of these things to help people sort of do what they need.

它们对你的成长产生完全相同的效果。然而，阶梯方法实际上更容易实施。在应用程序中实施成本更低，但很多时候我们过于忽视这一点。对吧？我们通常让B团队负责这类项目和服务。这实际上不是我们在Wufoo经常追踪的图表，甚至不是我引以为傲的图表。这才是我引以为傲的图表。因为尽管我们拥有这种漂亮、惊人的增长曲线，但真正重要的是这个刻度有多响亮？保持公司规模小巧，建立卓越的文化。这需要我们做很多这样的事情来帮助人们完成他们需要做的事情。

So John Gottman noticed there was a different type of behavior for relationships and why people divorced. Basically there would be some subset of people who would stay together 10, 15 years and then all of a sudden they divorce and there was none of the other indicators which sort of show that this is what was gonna happen. And I was looking through the data and I realized oh, there's no passion, there's no fire between these people, right? When it comes to relationships they kinda follow the second law of thermodynamics, right? In a closed energy system things tend to run down so you have to constantly be putting energy and effort back into it.

约翰·戈特曼注意到人际关系中存在一种特殊的行为模式，这解释了人们离婚的原因。基本上，有一部分人会在一起生活10年、15年，然后突然离婚，而没有任何其他迹象表明这种情况会发生。我查阅数据时意识到，这些人之间缺乏激情，没有火花，对吧？在人际关系方面，它们某种程度上遵循热力学第二定律，对吧？在一个封闭的能量系统中，事物往往会逐渐衰退，因此你必须不断地投入精力和努力。

Now the way a lot of people sort of think about showing people that I care about you in products and in companies is to do things like let's have a blog, right? Let's have a newsletter? The thing is, we look at these rates and basically it was such a small percentage of our active users that it was like, most of our users have no idea all the awesome stuff that we're doing for them.

现在很多人考虑在产品和企业中表达"我在乎你"的方式就是开设博客，对吧？或者发布新闻通讯？但问题是，当我们查看这些数据时发现，实际上只有极少数活跃用户参与，就好像我们的大多数用户根本不知道我们为他们做的所有精彩事情。

So we built a new tool. We called it the Wufoo system, and what it allowed us to do was just time stamp every new feature that we're building for users and then every time they would log in, we would look at the difference between their log in time or last log in time and the new features that were implemented. And when you had this message show up, hey since you've been gone here's all the awesome stuff that Wufoo did for you.

因此我们开发了一个新工具。我们称之为Wufoo系统，它让我们能够为每个为用户开发的新功能打上时间戳，然后每次用户登录时，我们会比较他们的登录时间或上次登录时间与已实施的新功能之间的差异。当这条消息出现时："嘿，自从你上次离开后，这是Wufoo为你做的所有精彩事情。"

Hands down this was the most talked about feature I've ever had every time I went out to talk to users. Right they'd say like dude I love that since you've been gone thing even though I pay the same amount every single month you guys are doing something for me almost every week and it's totally awesome and makes me feel, I'm getting maximum value.

毫无疑问，这是我每次与用户交流时最受热议的功能。他们会说："兄弟，我太喜欢那个'自从你离开后'的功能了，尽管我每个月支付相同的费用，但你们几乎每周都在为我做些事情，这太棒了，让我觉得物超所值。"

The other thing that we did in addition to having everyone support the people that paid their pay check is have them say thank you. And this was a large part due to us injecting sort of humility and modesty into the equation. Every single Friday we would get together and we'd just write simple hand written thank you cards to our users.

除了让每个人都支持那些支付他们薪水的人之外，我们做的另一件事是让他们表达感谢。这在很大程度上是因为我们在其中注入了谦逊和谦卑的元素。每个星期五我们都会聚在一起，为我们的用户手写简单的感谢卡。

And I know there's tons of people who would not be sort of excited about doing this, but it was a ritual that made sort of all the difference in terms of having a team that was very tightly knit, also. And working on stuff that they really cared about. They always constantly knew what the mission was for, and why we sort of did what we did.

我知道有很多人可能不会对做这种事情感到兴奋，但这是一种仪式，它在打造一个紧密团结的团队方面起到了关键作用。而且团队成员都在从事他们真正关心的工作。他们始终清楚地知道使命是什么，以及我们为什么要做我们所做的事情。

These aren't fancy thank you cards, right? They're just simple, like handwritten stuff on an index card. We threw in a sticker, and slapped on a dinosaur on the front of it. And, what's interesting is we started this practice as a result of the early days of starting Wufoo. Chris, Ron, and I were talking, and we're trying to figure out, what are we gonna do to sort of show users that we appreciate them around Christmas. And he, Chris came up with this idea where he said hey guys, so a couple years ago my mom, like, made me write thank you notes to all of my relatives for my Christmas gifts. And I didn't really like to do it but the following year all my presents were super good. So, I think we should try this for our business and see how it goes. So, that first year we wrote handwritten Christmas cards to all of our users that first year. Second year rolls around, and we have too many customers, like, and it's still just the three founders. And we were going like we're kinda screwed, I don't know what we're gonna do. And we read a book called the ultimate question, and in it he talks about hey, just focus on your most profitable users. And just tend them and take care of them, then it'll work out. So we're like, all right, that makes sense, that's scalable. So that year we only write to our highest paying customers. And the January rolls around that second year and one of our long time loyal users writes us and he's basically like, hey guys I really loved that Christmas card you sent me the first year.

这些不是花哨的感谢卡，对吧？它们很简单，就像在索引卡上写的手写内容。我们加了一张贴纸，还在正面贴了一只恐龙。有趣的是，我们开始这种做法是因为Wufoo创业初期。Chris、Ron和我在讨论，试图想出在圣诞节期间向用户表达感谢的方法。Chris想出了这个主意，他说几年前他妈妈让他给所有亲戚写感谢信，感谢他们送的圣诞礼物。他当时并不喜欢这么做，但第二年他收到的所有礼物都特别好。所以他认为我们应该在业务中尝试这个方法，看看效果如何。于是第一年我们给所有用户手写了圣诞贺卡。第二年到来时，我们的客户太多了，而公司仍然只有三位创始人。我们当时觉得完蛋了，不知道该怎么办。我们读了一本叫《终极问题》的书，书中提到只需关注最有利可图的用户，好好照顾他们，事情就会顺利。我们觉得这个建议很有道理，而且可扩展。所以那年我们只给最高付费客户写了贺卡。第二年一月，我们的一位长期忠实用户写信给我们，说他非常喜欢我们第一年寄给他的圣诞贺卡。

I just wanted you to know I haven't received my second card yet, and I'm just looking forward to it. I know you didn't forget about me. Thanks a lot.

So we're like, "Fuck," because the best way to sort of exceed expectations is not to send any to begin with, so we were sort of in this conundrum. And what we decided, after thinking about it for a while, is that we need to stop doing it just one time a year. It needs to be something that's part of the culture, happening every week even. And even though we'll never catch up to all of our customers, just the practice of doing it will make all the difference.

I talked a lot about a bunch of lovey-dovey stuff and sort of touchy-feely things that I think a lot of engineers don't like to think about too often. And so I'll end on some sort of hard business data or research. There's an article that was put out by the Harvard Business Review several years ago by Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, and in it they talk about the discipline of market leaders. They say there's only three ways that you achieve market dominance, and depending on how you want to achieve that market dominance, you have to organize your company in a very specific way: best price, best product, and best overall solution. If you want to be the best price out there, you focus on logistics—Walmart, Amazon. If you want to be the best product out there, you focus on R&D—Apple's usually a quintessential example of that. Best overall solution is

我想让你知道我还没收到第二张卡片，但我很期待。我知道你没有忘记我。非常感谢。

所以我们当时就想，"糟了"，因为超越期望的最好方式就是一开始什么都不寄送，所以我们陷入了这个困境。经过一段时间的思考，我们决定不能再一年只做一次了。这需要成为企业文化的一部分，甚至每周都要进行。尽管我们永远无法满足所有客户，但仅仅是坚持这样做的实践就会带来巨大改变。

我谈了很多关于温情脉脉、感性柔软的内容，我觉得很多工程师通常不太愿意过多思考这些。所以最后我会用一些硬核的商业数据或研究来结束。几年前《哈佛商业评论》刊登了一篇由Michael Treacy和Fred Wiersema撰写的文章，其中谈到了市场领导者的法则。他们说实现市场主导地位只有三种途径，根据你希望实现市场主导地位的方式，你必须以非常具体的方式组织公司：最优价格、最佳产品和最佳整体解决方案。如果你想成为价格最优者，就要专注于物流——比如沃尔玛、亚马逊。如果你想成为产品最佳者，就要专注于研发——苹果通常是个典型例子。最佳整体解决方案是

The best overall solution is about being customer intimate. This is the path that you see followed by luxury brands and the hospitality industry. What I love about this path towards market dominance is that the third one is the only one that everyone can do at any stage of their company. It requires almost no money to get started with, usually just courage. It requires a little bit of humility and some manners. As a result, you can achieve the success as any other people in your market. That's all I got. Thank you very much. Let's take some questions if you guys have any.

最佳的整体解决方案在于与客户保持亲密关系。这是奢侈品牌和酒店业所遵循的路径。我喜欢这条通往市场主导地位的路径，因为第三种方法是唯一一种任何公司在任何阶段都可以实施的方法。它几乎不需要资金就可以开始，通常只需要勇气。它需要一点谦逊和一些礼仪。因此，你可以像市场中其他任何人一样获得成功。这就是我要分享的全部内容。非常感谢大家。如果你们有任何问题，我们来回答一些问题。

Right in the back there. A lot of other people are present. So just start one at a time. A lot of the examples that you see up there, many people make the mistake of thinking they should make their app funny. However, humor is really difficult to execute. What you should aim for is something witty. Quite honestly, you have to get the functionality right first, like Japanese quality standards. If you don't have that foundation, don't attempt anything witty because it will backfire. Our number one focus is making it as easy to use as possible, and anything else beyond that is just polish.

就在后面那里。还有很多其他人。所以请一个一个来。你们在上面看到的很多例子中，很多人犯的错误就是认为应该让他们的应用变得有趣。然而，幽默真的很难把握。你应该追求的是某种机智的表达。老实说，你必须先把功能做好，就像日本的质量标准那样。如果没有这个基础，就不要尝试任何机智的东西，因为这会适得其反。我们的首要重点是让它尽可能易于使用，除此之外的任何东西都只是锦上添花。

And the thing is, it starts off as you juggling tons of things constantly in the air. The thing is, if you're working on products, you should also always have this flip side when you're talking to users. And for us inside of Wufoo, the way we got people to talk to users is they just did customer support. And they got to see firsthand, right away, whether that feature sucked or not, and also impacted everyone else in the company, because everyone had a customer support shift. So you have this sort of social incentive to sort of make everything work. And so, like I said, there should be no point where you're only focused on product. You should always have time where you work on product, and then you see sort of what users say to you. And you should always have this virtual feedback loop on there. So be careful when you don't have that.

关键是，一开始就像你不断地在空中抛接无数事物。关键在于，如果你从事产品工作，当你与用户交流时，也应该始终关注另一面。对我们Wufoo内部而言，我们让员工与用户沟通的方式就是让他们直接处理客户支持。他们能立即亲眼看到某个功能是否糟糕，这也会影响公司里的其他所有人，因为每个人都有客户支持轮班。这样你就有了某种社会动力去确保一切正常运转。正如我所说，任何时候都不应该只专注于产品。你应该始终有时间既处理产品事务，又能了解用户对你的反馈。你应该始终保持这种虚拟的反馈循环。所以当你缺乏这种循环时就要当心了。

That person is your sales force for you right here. How do you find crystal clear customer or user need where the demand is there for the right solution? How do you communicate with engineering and designing team to make sure that, because sometimes people in the team come up with ideas, but still at the end of the day, how can you make a decision on where to go? How do you make a decision on product and communicate that with your engineering team when there's lots of different directions to go?

My feeling is that for us we just looked at support. It was really easy because you often just saw what are things that people are having the most amount of problems with, or people asking all the time. You cannot help but get feature requests from people no matter what opening or orifice you have in your product or app. People will jam feature requests in there, so you're easily going to know what they want.

Your job as a product person and engineer is to not just do what they say, because that way you'll just be a slave. It is to figure out deeply what are the reasons underlying those things and solve that deep underlying reason. The thing is that everyone wants to have a different way to go, then ultimately it comes down to someone figuring something out. But I also make the smallest version of each little idea, no longer than a week or two weeks to build it out there. And you can try them out and see what works and doesn't work.

那个人就是你的销售团队，就在这里。你如何找到明确的客户或用户需求，以及存在正确解决方案的需求？你如何与工程和设计团队沟通确保，因为有时团队成员会提出各种想法，但最终你如何决定方向？当存在多种不同方向时，你如何做出产品决策并与工程团队沟通？

我的感觉是，对我们来说，我们只是关注支持工作。这真的很简单，因为你经常能看到人们遇到最多问题的地方，或者人们一直在询问的内容。无论你的产品或应用程序有什么入口或接口，你都不可避免地会收到人们的功能请求。人们会把功能请求塞进来，所以你很容易就能知道他们想要什么。

作为产品人员和工程师，你的工作不仅仅是按照他们说的做，因为那样你只会成为奴隶。而是要深入思考这些要求背后的原因，并解决那个深层次的根本原因。问题是每个人都想走不同的路，最终还是要有人做出决定。但我会为每个小想法制作最小版本，构建时间不超过一两周。然后你可以尝试它们，看看哪些有效，哪些无效。

I think it's dangerous to have multiple different product directions that requires lots of time to sort of figure out. So I don't like hackathons. I think they sort of suck in terms of ones done inside of companies. Because you spend like 48 hours working on something really hard that you're sort of passionate about and 99% of them never make it to production right, and it's sort of real like super sad. So for us we like flipped it on its head and we came up with an idea that we called king for a day and it actually worked over the weekend. But how it worked is someone randomly in the company got drawn and they got to be the king, and the king got to tell everyone else what to do on the product. So everything that was bothering them about Wufoo, about the customer support stuff, or some feature they really want to have built. They've got the engineering resources, the market resources, the advertising resources of everyone inside of the company, to make it sort of happen. And of course, we'd work with them to figure out like what can be actually done in 48 hours. But we would do this one to two times a year. And it was like a huge hit and it was a boost to morale, cuz what people most love is like working on things where it's like, oh, I made a difference to the app. And so, for us, that's one way that we would like sort of divide time for like product direction.

我认为拥有多个不同的产品方向是很危险的，这需要大量时间去摸索。所以我不喜欢黑客马拉松。我觉得公司内部举办的黑客马拉松效果很差。因为你花了大约48小时努力研究自己热衷的东西，但其中99%的项目最终都无法投产，这真的很令人沮丧。因此我们反其道而行之，想出了一个叫做"一日国王"的点子，而且这个方案在周末确实奏效了。具体运作方式是随机抽取公司里的一名员工成为国王，国王可以告诉其他所有人要在产品上做什么。无论是关于Wufoo让他们困扰的地方，客户支持方面的问题，还是他们真正想要开发的某个功能。他们可以获得公司内部所有人的工程资源、市场资源、广告资源，让这些想法得以实现。当然，我们会与他们合作，确定在48小时内实际可以完成什么。我们每年会进行一到两次这样的活动。这活动大受欢迎，也提升了士气，因为人们最喜欢的就是能够参与那些能让自己感到"哦，我为这个应用带来了改变"的工作。所以对我们来说，这是我们在产品方向规划上分配时间的一种方式。

And all that stuff, and how we sort of balance that. It's like sometimes the people that work for you have a strong opinion about where it should go. And it's a good way to sort of democratize it a little bit by rotating it around.

所有这些事情，以及我们如何平衡这些。有时候为你工作的人对于事情应该朝哪个方向发展有强烈的意见。通过轮换的方式来稍微民主化是一个好方法。

You said you guys all work from home. Usually seems like a nightmare. In that office, how do you make that work? Okay, so we all work from home. I will tell you this. We all still work within the Tampa Bay area. We would allow anybody to work from anywhere but usually, as we tried to recruit them, they sort of meet our team, and they just decide to come and move here anyway.

你说你们都居家办公。通常这看起来像是一场噩梦。在那个办公室里，你们是如何实现这一点的？好的，我们都居家办公。我要告诉你的是，我们仍然都在坦帕湾地区工作。我们允许任何人在任何地方工作，但通常当我们试图招聘他们时，他们会与我们的团队见面，然后就决定无论如何都要来这里。

Remote working is especially tricky. A lot of people like to romanticize it, especially people who are like employees. But the thing is, an office gives you a lot of benefits and efficiencies that you now have to compensate for when you're remote working. But remote working also has these other sort of efficiencies in place. For example, I don't have to worry about my employees losing two hours of their day to commuting.

远程工作尤其棘手。很多人喜欢将其浪漫化，尤其是像员工这样的人。但问题是，办公室给你带来了很多好处和效率，现在在远程工作时你必须弥补这些。但远程工作也有其他类型的效率优势。例如，我不必担心我的员工每天因为通勤而损失两个小时。

So the biggest thing that we had to do for remote working is to respect people's time. And so the way we had it set up is we actually had a four and a half day work week at Wufoo. Half day on Friday was for all the meetings and stuff. We said like no business deal meetings, no talking with other outside parties. They all have to be done on Friday, on that half day. It couldn't be done in the middle of the week.

因此，我们为远程工作必须做的最重要的事情是尊重人们的时间。所以我们设置的方式是，在Wufoo实际上实行了四天半的工作周。周五的半天用于所有的会议等事务。我们规定没有商务交易会议，不与外部各方交谈。所有这些都必须在周五的半天内完成。不能在周中进行。

For instance, we had one day dedicated to customer support. So everyone in our company effectively only had three days each week to actually build or work on whatever they were doing. But I actually firmly believe that if you have three solid days, right, eight to ten hours, where you are only working on what you need to build, you can get a ton of shit done. And so what we said was, you have to respect everyone's time during that three day period, if they're in that three day period. And what we came up with is a 15 minute rule and the way it worked is you can have a discussion like a chat or a phone call or whatever with someone but it could go no longer than 15 minutes. So if you have some complicated issue that you couldn't figure out, we'd say at 15 minutes you are to immediately table that item, right, and have us discuss it on Friday, and you'd move on to the next item on your list. The enhanced productivity: more often than not, I would say 90% of the time the item never got brought up on Friday because usually what would happen is people would sleep on it and then they'd just magically say like, hey I found a solution or like hey that's not a big problem whatsoever. Because most problems inside of companies don't need to be solved in real time, or right away. The only things are like when the site is down, or payments aren't working. Everything outside of that is basically kind of luxury, so focus on your primaries as much as possible. And, as a result, our ten person team did far more than many other companies.

例如，我们安排了一天专门用于客户支持。因此，公司每个人实际上每周只有三天时间真正用于构建或处理他们正在做的事情。但我坚信，如果你有三天完整的时间，每天八到十小时，只专注于需要构建的内容，你就能完成大量工作。所以我们规定，在这三天期间必须尊重每个人的时间。我们制定了15分钟规则：你可以与他人进行聊天、电话等讨论，但不得超过15分钟。如果遇到无法解决的复杂问题，15分钟时必须立即搁置该事项，留待周五讨论，然后继续处理清单上的下一项。这种效率提升体现在：大多数情况下（约90%），这些问题周五时根本不会被提及，因为人们经过思考后往往会神奇地说"我找到解决方案了"或"这根本不是大问题"。因为公司内部的大多数问题并不需要实时或立即解决。只有网站宕机或支付故障等特殊情况才需紧急处理。除此之外的问题基本上都属于次要事项，因此应尽可能专注于主要任务。结果就是，我们十人团队完成的工作量远超许多其他公司。

For instance, it takes extra work to make remote working happen. We are an extremely disciplined sort of team. I would have to say there's almost not many YC companies that actually have been able to replicate what we do. I think there's only two other companies in YC that have the same sort of discipline working style. It takes more work in a very different fashion. An office allows you to be a little bit lazier in terms of all these things around productivity.

例如，实现远程工作需要付出额外的努力。我们是一个非常自律的团队。我必须说，几乎没有多少YC公司能够真正复制我们的做法。我认为YC中只有另外两家公司拥有类似的自律工作风格。这需要以非常不同的方式付出更多努力。在生产力相关事务方面，办公室环境允许你稍微懒散一些。

And then also one day, we updated their to-do list. What we said is every single night just set everything that you did that day. Right? And then on Friday, we would just go over. Okay, this is what you said last week that you're gonna do. This is what you actually got done, or the sort of the problems at hand. And it's super simple, right? It creates this like nice written trail for how to sort of handle stuff, right? And I don't have to worry about managing them, right? They sorta set the tone for how they want to be sort of assessed. And it makes it really simple. And for people who are excellent at what they do, right? It works very, very well. And then when you actually have problems, it's very easy to fire people. I was fortunate that I never had to fire anyone at Wufoo, right? But we were able to correct a lot of people's behavior very, very quickly. Because we just kinda look at this, and it's like look, this is your pattern of behavior. You finish a fraction of the items on your list. You do most of the items at the last second right before Friday. That's a problem, you've gotta manage your time better and this is evidence that you've provided to us. All we have to do is sort of describe it back to you and because everyone in the company sort of sees it, right, there's social pressure that's put into place that helps make it all sort of happen.

然后有一天，我们更新了他们的待办事项清单。我们说的是每天晚上记录你当天完成的所有事情。对吧？然后在周五，我们会进行回顾。好的，这是你上周说要完成的事情。这是你实际完成的情况，或者当前面临的问题。这非常简单，对吧？它创建了一个很好的书面记录，用于指导如何处理事务，对吧？我不必担心管理他们，对吧？他们某种程度上设定了希望如何被评估的基调。这让事情变得非常简单。对于那些在本职工作中表现出色的人来说，对吧？这种方法效果非常好。当你真正遇到问题时，解雇员工就变得非常容易。我很幸运在Wufoo从未需要解雇任何人，对吧？但我们能够非常迅速地纠正很多人的行为。因为我们只需要看看这个，就像这样，这是你的行为模式。你只完成了清单上的一小部分项目。你大部分项目都是在周五前的最后一刻完成的。这是个问题，你需要更好地管理时间，这是你提供给我们的证据。我们只需要把这些情况反馈给你，因为公司里的每个人都能看到，对吧，这种社会压力有助于让一切顺利进行。

How did you hire people that you felt would be able to work in this kind of environment? So, how do you hire people that can work remotely and work in this sort of fashion? Pretty easily, you have them work on a side project for you. So you contract them out, and they have to work remotely. As such, usually the projects I like to have them work on is about a month long, right? I could do things much faster for a week, but usually get a good sense of how well people sort of manage themselves and work on things from a project like that. So that was always the first assessment. Like we never did anything just by interviews. The other thing we had to screen them for is their ability to do customer support. Because not every engineer has the empathy skills to handle that stress. So sometimes I would have people write breakup letters to me in an interview. Just like, hey, pretend you have to break up with me, you have 15 minutes to write it on there and you can only write it by hand, what are you gonna say? And so you get a good sense of their writing skills, because like 90% of what you do in customer support is tell them bad news, like, oh, we don't support that feature, sorry that's not gonna work, or it's not gonna be available. And so people have to have sort of tact at that.

你是如何雇佣那些你认为能够在这种环境中工作的人？那么，你如何雇佣能够远程工作并以这种方式工作的人？很简单，你让他们为你做一个副业项目。所以你把他们外包出去，他们必须远程工作。因此，通常我喜欢让他们做的项目大约持续一个月，对吧？我可以在一周内更快地完成事情，但通常能很好地了解人们如何管理自己以及从这样的项目中完成工作。所以这始终是第一个评估。就像我们从不只通过面试来做任何事情。我们必须筛选的另一件事是他们处理客户支持的能力。因为并非每个工程师都有处理这种压力的同理心技能。所以有时候我会在面试中让人们给我写分手信。就像，嘿，假装你必须和我分手，你有15分钟的时间在上面写，而且只能手写，你会说什么？这样你就能很好地了解他们的写作技巧，因为客户支持中90%的工作是告诉他们坏消息，比如，哦，我们不支持那个功能，抱歉那行不通，或者那将不可用。所以人们必须在这方面有一定的技巧。

of ones that didn't work out?]

How about one more question? Are there any experiments to help the company that didn't work out? All right, I'll talk about one. So one of the things that we did early on to try to motivate ourselves was to understand this idea of crunch mode and that it's really bad for people. If you're doing the subscription business, you need people to last for the long term. In video games, they often crunch people all the time for specific deadlines or have multiple sprints every two weeks where you have to shoot up to this deadline, and it's exhausting. When it's happening, you might get an increase in productivity, but the recovery period that you need for people is always greater than the productivity you gain. At a company where you need everyone doing customer support, being on their game, and constantly pushing out features, you don't have time for recovery. So we were thinking about building a company vacation into how Wufoo works to reward our users every single year. We said if the vacation is built in there for recovery, we could have one crunch period before that vacation setup. The way we did the very first crunch mode is that it was just between the three founders, and we had each of us draw a ten-item to-do list that would be fairly aggressive.

再来一个问题怎么样？有没有哪些旨在帮助公司的实验没有成功？好的，我来谈谈一个例子。我们早期为了激励自己而做的一件事，就是理解"冲刺模式"这个概念，以及它对人们确实很不利。如果你从事订阅业务，你需要员工能够长期坚持。在视频游戏行业，他们经常让员工为了特定截止日期而持续加班，或者每两周进行多次冲刺，必须赶在截止日期前完成，这非常累人。当这种情况发生时，你可能会获得生产力的提升，但员工所需的恢复期总是大于你获得的生产力收益。在一个需要每个人都做客户支持、保持最佳状态并不断推出新功能的公司里，你没有时间进行恢复。所以我们考虑在Wufoo的运作方式中建立公司假期，每年奖励我们的用户。我们说如果假期是为了恢复而设立的，我们就可以在假期安排之前有一个冲刺期。我们实施第一个冲刺模式的方式是只在三位创始人之间进行，我们每个人都制定了一个包含十个项目的待办事项清单，这个清单相当具有挑战性。

The first person to get through seven of their items would win, and the last person to get through seven of their items would become what we called trippage. Trippage meant that you carried other person's luggage and got people drinks when you're on the company vacation. We did that and during that period, everyone was pretty excited about it and motivated. Only the winner got to choose the next company vacation the following year. Then all the sudden Ryan had basically poorly estimated the items on his list and realized very quickly he was going to lose. So he just gave up and stopped. Crunch mode turned out to be blah mode for him because he knew he was gonna lose and became pretty demoralized. As a result of doing that, we decided not to do it in that similar fashion anymore. It was a good idea that we like to talk about, but is one that we never did again.

第一个完成七项任务的人获胜，而最后一个完成七项任务的人则成为我们所谓的"旅行苦力"。"旅行苦力"意味着在公司度假期间，你需要为他人搬运行李并准备饮料。我们实施了这项制度，在那段时间里，大家都对此感到相当兴奋并充满动力。只有获胜者有权选择下一年的公司度假地点。然后突然间，瑞安严重低估了自己清单上的任务量，并很快意识到自己必输无疑。于是他直接放弃并停止了努力。对他而言，冲刺模式变成了无趣模式，因为他知道自己会输，变得相当沮丧。因此，我们决定不再采用类似的方式。这是个我们喜欢谈论的好主意，但却是我们再也没有重复过的做法。
