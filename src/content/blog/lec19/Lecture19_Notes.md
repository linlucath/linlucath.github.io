Okay, great. So, thanks for having me. My name's Tyler, I'm the CEO of Clever, and what I want to talk about today is sales. I have a little bit of insight into this. I graduated college, I actually studied math and statistics, probably like some of you here in this room. I thought I was destined for this world of finance. I was about to go start at a hedge fund. At the last second, a friend of mine roped me in to join his startup and asked me to do sales there, which was something that I knew nothing about. I had to figure it out on the fly and spent a couple of years there, figuring out sales for this very early stage company. When it came to start Clever, we started it with two co-founders who are very technical, and one very product-oriented. We wanted to build this product for schools, and I thought that experience would have no relevancy whatsoever. But it turns out that some of the things that I picked up at this previous job, where I was figuring out sales, have been huge parts of what's made Clever grow so quickly today.

好的，很棒。感谢邀请我。我叫泰勒，是 Clever 公司的首席执行官，今天我想谈谈销售。我对这方面有一些见解。我大学毕业后，实际上学习的是数学和统计学，可能和在座的某些人一样。我以为自己注定要进入金融界。我即将去一家对冲基金工作。在最后一刻，我的一个朋友拉我加入他的初创公司，并让我负责销售工作，这对我来说是完全陌生的领域。我不得不边做边学，在那里花了几年时间为这家早期阶段的公司摸索销售之道。当我们创立 Clever 时，我和两位技术背景很强的联合创始人以及一位非常注重产品的人一起创办了这家公司。我们想为学校打造这个产品，我当时认为之前的经验毫无关联。但事实证明，我在之前那份工作中摸索销售时学到的一些东西，如今已成为 Clever 快速成长的重要组成部分。

Quick background on Clever: we build software for schools. We are an app platform used by developers, and it's used today by about one in five schools in America. We started it about two years ago. Sales have been a key piece of that, and I want to use this time to just share some of the things that have worked for me along the way. Of course, there's a million ways to do this, so you'll find what works for you.

关于 Clever 的简要背景：我们为学校开发软件。我们是一个供开发者使用的应用平台，目前美国约有五分之一的学校在使用我们的产品。我们大约两年前创立了这家公司。销售一直是其中的关键部分，我想借此机会分享一些在此过程中对我有效的方法。当然，做销售有无数种方式，所以你会找到适合自己的方法。

So first I want to start about how I used to perceive sales. A lot of people see sales as having a lot of mystique around it.

首先，我想谈谈我过去对销售的看法。很多人认为销售带有许多神秘色彩。

You know, it's people who are really articulate and impossibly charming. And they have these killer closing lines that they use. And I think this is how I saw sales, and I think this is how a lot of founders I talked to see sales, because they say things to me like, we're just going to work on the product and build a great product, and then when it's finally finished we're going to hire the salespeople.

你知道，那些口才出众、魅力非凡的人。他们还有这些杀手级的结束语。我认为这就是我对销售的认知，也是我接触过的许多创始人对销售的认知，因为他们会对我说，我们只需要专注于产品，打造一款优秀的产品，等到产品最终完成后，我们再雇佣销售人员。

And what I've learned is that hire the salespeople, as a founder, the reality is that's you.

而我学到的教训是，雇佣销售人员这件事，作为创始人，现实就是你自己就是那个销售人员。

And so you know, Paul Graham likes to talk about how there's two things you should be doing at any point in time when you're starting your company. You're either talking to your users or you're building your product. And that talking to your users part, that's selling.

所以你知道，保罗·格雷厄姆喜欢谈论在创业过程中的任何时间点，你应该做两件事：要么与用户交流，要么打造产品。而与用户交流的那部分，就是销售。

You know, this is intimidating to some people because they're like, I've never done sales, and I wouldn't even know where to begin. But it turns out that as a founder, you have some unique advantages that make it possible for you to be really, really good at sales. And one of those is your passion for the product, and what you're building. And the second is your industry knowledge of the industry and the problem that you're solving. And those two things actually totally trump sales experience from what I've seen.

你知道，这对一些人来说很吓人，因为他们会说，我从未做过销售，甚至不知道从哪里开始。但事实证明，作为创始人，你拥有一些独特的优势，使你有能力在销售方面表现得非常出色。其中之一是你对产品和所打造事物的热情。第二是你对行业和所解决问题的行业知识。根据我的观察，这两点实际上完全胜过销售经验。

So, this is actually my cofounder, doing sales. This is what sales looks like in the very early stage of a startup. It's not Don Draper. It's a lot of calls like these. But this is something that even as a founder who's never done it before, it's very easy to do,

所以，这实际上是我的联合创始人正在进行销售。这就是初创公司早期阶段的销售场景。这不是唐·德雷珀式的销售。而是大量像这样的电话沟通。但即使是作为从未做过销售的创始人，这也是非常容易做到的，

But this is something that even as a founder who's never done it before, it's very easy to do, but you have to commit yourself. And what we did at Clever was we dedicated one founder, which was me, to peel off and say, okay, Tyler you're going to go figure this out and work on this full time because it's so important to our business.

但即使是作为从未做过这件事的创始人，这也非常容易做到，但你必须全身心投入。我们在 Clever 的做法是专门安排一位创始人——也就是我——抽身出来负责这项工作，并对我说："Tyler，你要去解决这个问题并全职投入，因为这对我们的业务至关重要。"

So, couple things that I've picked up about sales along the way and in trying to figure this out. You know, the first thing that everybody knows about sales is they say, okay, it's a funnel. And you have these different stages of funnels and you move your customers through it. Pretty common categories. There's this prospecting category where you're trying to figure out who's even interested. Then you're having a lot of conversations, which is the second level of the funnel. Then you're finding out who's really serious and you want to close them and sign the deal. And then, of course, you're in the promised land of revenue.

因此，在解决这个问题的过程中，我学到了关于销售的几件事。大家都知道，销售的第一要义就是所谓的销售漏斗。漏斗有不同的阶段，你需要引导客户通过这些阶段。这是相当常见的分类方式。首先是潜在客户开发阶段，你需要找出哪些人感兴趣。然后是大量沟通阶段，这是漏斗的第二层。接着是确定哪些客户真正有意向，你想要完成交易并签署协议。当然，最后你就进入了收益的乐土。

And what I thought would be interesting would be to talk about each of the stage, a couple strategies that we've used at Clever that have worked really well. So that these aren't abstract things but things that, you know, you can hopefully use at your startup. So, prospecting. So, prospecting is the process of figuring out who will even take your call.

我认为有趣的是讨论每个阶段，以及我们在 Clever 使用过的一些非常有效的策略。这样这些就不是抽象的概念，而是希望你能在自己的初创公司中实际应用的方法。那么，先说潜在客户开发。潜在客户开发就是找出哪些人愿意接你电话的过程。

And you know, one of the things that I realized early on, so there's this guy Everett Rogers who's created this technology life cycle adoption curve. And he describes it as bell curve where you've got your innovators and who will try new things, and you've got your early adopters, your mid-stage adopters, your late adopters, your laggards. And one of the things that was really helpful for

我早期意识到的一点是，有位叫 Everett Rogers 的人创建了技术采用生命周期曲线。他将其描述为钟形曲线，其中有创新者——那些愿意尝试新事物的人，还有早期采用者、中期采用者、晚期采用者和落后者。其中一个对

One of the things that was really helpful for me in understanding sales in an early startup is he quantified the tail of this bell curve. This part over here, the innovators, those are your potential customers. It might seem discouraging that only 2.5% of companies are your potential customers that would even consider buying from a startup that has no users and no revenue. But actually, I found just the opposite. I found it to be extremely helpful to have this frame of mind, because you realize when only 2.5% of companies will even take your call or consider using your product, you realize what a numbers game this becomes. So if you want to reach that 2.5% and you want to get some early sales, if you're starting to do math, you're hopefully starting to realize you have to do a lot of calling. You have to talk to a lot of people. Early on in the early days at Clever, this was my job. In the first two months of YC, I reached out to over 400 companies trying to get them to take a call and talk to us about what we're building.

在理解早期初创企业销售方面，对我非常有帮助的一点是他量化了这个钟形曲线的尾部。这里的创新者部分，就是你的潜在客户。只有 2.5%的公司会考虑从没有用户和收入的初创公司购买产品，这看起来可能令人沮丧。但实际上，我发现恰恰相反。我发现拥有这种思维模式非常有帮助，因为当你意识到只有 2.5%的公司会接听你的电话或考虑使用你的产品时，你就会明白这变成了一个数字游戏。所以，如果你想触达那 2.5%并获得一些早期销售，如果你开始计算，你可能会意识到你必须打很多电话。你必须与很多人交谈。在 Clever 早期，这就是我的工作。在 YC 的前两个月，我联系了 400 多家公司，试图让他们接听电话并与我们讨论我们正在构建的产品。

There are three ways that I have found most successful in prospecting and getting these people. One is your personal network, which is obvious and I'm not going to spend any time there. Another one is conferences, which is surprising to a lot of people. Then the one that people are most familiar with is cold email. When I say conferences, this is what people think. They think I'm talking about CES or E3 or something. Actually, the kind of conferences where sales happen look more like this. In the early days we would go to a lot of these because you have to go where your users are.

我发现在寻找潜在客户和获取这些客户方面，有三种方法最为成功。一种是你的人脉网络，这很明显，我就不多说了。另一种是会议，这让很多人感到惊讶。然后人们最熟悉的是冷邮件。当我说会议时，人们会这样想。他们认为我指的是 CES 或 E3 之类的展会。实际上，真正发生销售的会议更像是这样的。早期我们会参加很多这样的会议，因为你必须去你的用户所在的地方。

If you're selling to CIOs and there happens to be a gathering of them at a hotel in Milwaukee, guess what, that's probably where you should be. So we go to conferences like these. We get the attendee lists in advance. We email every single person in advance and try to set up meetings so that when we get there, every single minute of that trip was well spent. This was huge in Clever's early days. This was where we met all of our earliest customers.

The second thing I mentioned is cold email. A lot of people don't know how to write cold emails. It's actually really easy, and the key is not to write a lot. It should be really concise. This is an email template that I used early on and you're welcome to copy it, but it's really short. Here's who I am, here's what I'm building, and I'd love to talk to you about this. Could we find time tomorrow? It's really easy and you can customize this and find out for every business you want to sell to who's the right person to send it to and you can send out quite a few of these.

So all right, that's prospecting. The reason this is so important is because you've got to build that first layer of the funnel. Then you get them to take your call. And this is another place where a lot of founders I think just have a lot of questions about what to actually do. The biggest thing to take away, in fact if you only take away one thing from this presentation today, the number one thing you should remember is when you get them on the phone, remember to shut up. And that's really surprising to people.

如果你要向首席信息官销售产品，而他们正好在密尔沃基的一家酒店聚会，那么你猜怎么着，那里很可能就是你应该去的地方。所以我们参加这类会议。我们提前获取参会者名单。我们提前给每个人发邮件，并尝试安排会议，这样当我们到达时，行程中的每一分钟都得到了充分利用。这在 Clever 早期非常重要。这就是我们遇到所有早期客户的地方。

我提到的第二件事是冷邮件。很多人不知道如何写冷邮件。其实这真的很容易，关键不在于写很多内容。应该非常简洁。这是我早期使用的邮件模板，欢迎你复制它，但它真的很简短。我是谁，我在做什么产品，我很想和你谈谈这个。我们明天能找个时间聊聊吗？这真的很简单，你可以根据每个你想销售的企业定制这个模板，找出应该发送给谁，并且你可以发送很多这样的邮件。

好了，这就是潜在客户开发。这件事如此重要的原因是因为你必须建立销售漏斗的第一层。然后你让他们接听你的电话。这是另一个我认为很多创始人对于实际该做什么有很多疑问的地方。最重要的收获是，事实上如果你今天只能从这次演讲中记住一件事，那么你应该记住的首要事情是：当你让他们接听电话时，记得闭嘴。这让很多人感到非常惊讶。

So many founders, when I help them with their first sales pitch, they finally get somebody on the phone who wants to talk to them about their product. And they're so proud of this thing they've been building for the last three months that all they want to do is get on the phone and talk about every feature and talk about all the different things they can do and talk about why it's the greatest thing in the world. And I have that temptation too. It's just part of being really proud of something. But it turns out that if you watch the best salespeople, like the best salespeople in the world, the top 1%, and you have a chance to listen in on a call with some of those people, like I have, the most surprising thing is how little talking they do. In fact, I've seen calls where the salesperson told me their goal was to only spend 30% of the call talking, and have 70% of the call the other person. And they would ask a lot of questions. They'd say things like, why did you even agree to take my call today? This problem that we're talking about solving for you, how do you solve it today? You know, what would your ideal solution look like? And they're not doing the talking. They're finding, they're doing everything they can to find out what this person needs, and hopefully understand their problem even better than they do. That's what really great sales is and in fact this is something I drill into everybody at Clever. It's a really important part of sales and there's actually now if any of you use Uber Conference, they have this amazing feature where when you hang up a call it sends you an email automatically and tells you how much you talked versus how much the other person talked.

很多创始人在我帮助他们准备第一次销售演讲时，他们终于找到了愿意在电话里讨论产品的人。他们对自己过去三个月打造的产品感到无比自豪，以至于只想在电话里谈论每个功能、所有能做的事情，以及为什么这是世界上最棒的产品。我也有这种冲动。这只是对某件事感到真正自豪的一部分。但事实证明，如果你观察最优秀的销售人员，比如世界上顶尖的 1%的销售人员，并且有机会像我一样旁听他们的电话，最令人惊讶的是他们说话如此之少。事实上，我见过一些电话销售，销售人员告诉我他们的目标是只占用 30%的通话时间说话，而让对方占用 70%的时间。他们会问很多问题。他们会说：您今天为什么同意接我的电话？我们正在讨论为您解决的这个问题，您目前是如何解决的？您理想中的解决方案是什么样的？他们不是在说话，而是在尽一切努力找出这个人的需求，甚至希望能比他们自己更了解他们的问题。这才是真正出色的销售，事实上这也是我在 Clever 公司向每个人反复强调的事情。这是销售中非常重要的一部分，现在如果你们有人使用 Uber Conference，他们有一个很棒的功能：当你挂断电话时，它会自动发送一封邮件，告诉你你说话的时间与对方说话时间的比例。

If someone doing sales at Clever gets one of those emails, I can tell immediately how likely the sale is based on how much talking we were doing. So, you got all these people now you got on the phone, do a lot of listening, really understand their problem. The other part of this stage that surprises a lot of people is follow up. There are a lot of different steps that you can imagine going through: emailing somebody, not getting a response, and emailing them back; calling them, leaving a voice mail, having a pricing call. There are probably about 60 things on this slide that could be steps for closing a deal. These actually aren't just random things. This is one deal that was the second deal Clever ever signed. These are all the different steps that we had to go through in order to get this done. You can see there's a lot of really embarrassing things up there, like I emailed somebody and they didn't respond, and I emailed them again and they didn't respond, and then I emailed them again. This is from somebody who wanted to buy our product. Isn't that crazy? That surprises a lot of people. I see so many founders today have a great call with someone, they send an email, they don't hear back and they say, "Oh, that person might not be interested." Well, guess what, this is what it looks like in the best case. So you really have to have this unhuman, unreasonable willingness to follow up and drive things to closure. Now, qualify that with one thing, which is to say, when you're starting a company, your time is extremely valuable.

如果 Clever 的销售人员收到这样的邮件，我就能立即根据我们之前的对话量判断成交的可能性有多大。所以，当你与所有这些人在电话上沟通时，要多倾听，真正理解他们的问题。这个阶段另一个让很多人惊讶的部分是跟进工作。你可以想象需要经历很多不同的步骤：给某人发邮件，没有收到回复，再给他们发邮件；打电话，留下语音邮件，进行价格讨论。这张幻灯片上大概有 60 个可能促成交易的步骤。这些实际上并非随意列举的事项。这是 Clever 签署的第二笔交易。这些都是我们为达成交易必须经历的各种步骤。你可以看到上面有很多令人尴尬的事情，比如我发了邮件对方没回复，我又发了一次他们还是没回复，然后我又发了第三次。这还是来自一个想购买我们产品的人。这难道不疯狂吗？这让很多人感到惊讶。我看到如今很多创始人与某人进行了很好的通话，发了邮件，没收到回复就说"哦，那个人可能不感兴趣"。但猜猜看，这已经是最好的情况了。所以你确实需要具备这种近乎非人的、不合理的跟进意愿，推动事情达成。现在，需要补充说明一点：当你创办公司时，你的时间极其宝贵。

Because it's your only resource, and you couldn't possibly do this for every single person who might buy your product. So your goal should be to get people to a yes or a no, as quickly as you can. Where you die is if you have a thousand maybes. And sometimes I talk to founders who say, "Oh, yeah, I have this great pipeline of, you know, a hundred people who are, who have expressed interest in our product." And the maybes are what kill you. If you can get to a yes or a no, in some ways a no is even better than a maybe. Because it allows you to move on and focus on somebody who might be a yes. So, have this super-human level of follow up and ambition, but make sure you're focusing it on the right pieces.

因为这是你唯一的资源，而且你不可能为每个可能购买你产品的人都这样做。所以你的目标应该是让人们尽快给出肯定或否定的答复。如果你有一千个"可能"，那将是致命的。有时我和创始人交谈，他们会说："哦，是的，我有一条很棒的渠道，有一百个人对我们的产品表示感兴趣。"而这些"可能"正是会毁掉你的因素。如果你能得到肯定或否定的答复，在某些方面，否定甚至比"可能"更好。因为它能让你继续前进，专注于那些可能给出肯定答复的人。所以，要具备超乎常人的跟进能力和雄心，但要确保你专注于正确的方向。

All right. So you've talked to someone, you've talked to a ton of people. You've had all these phone calls. You've followed up with them ridiculously to the point where they just know you're not going away, and they've gotta sign an agreement. This final step is something that, if you haven't done before, it might seem opaque, but it's actually really simple. It's called redlining. So you'll send over an agreement. Their lawyers will mark it up. Your lawyers will mark it up and you kind of go back and forth. If you're part of YC, this is really easy because YC has standard template agreements that they give you. So you don't have to find these and you can just use those.

好的。所以你已经和一些人谈过，和很多人谈过。你打了所有这些电话。你进行了极其夸张的跟进，直到他们明白你不会放弃，他们必须签署协议。这最后一步，如果你以前没有做过，可能会显得晦涩难懂，但实际上非常简单。这被称为红线标记。所以你会发送一份协议。他们的律师会进行标记。你的律师也会进行标记，然后你们来回沟通。如果你是 YC 的一部分，这真的很容易，因为 YC 会给你提供标准的模板协议。所以你不需要寻找这些，直接使用它们就可以了。

But they've never been available. If you weren't part of YC you kind of had to figure this out on your own. One of the things that I'm really excited about is, as part of this presentation, YC has agreed to open source their deal documents. So these documents that YC founders used to get are now going to be available to everybody. So this should never, hopefully, never be a barrier to anyone who wants to do sales for their start up. You've got some great documents. And then the other thing I'll say about this, a place I see so many smart people go wrong, is you gotta remember what your goal is. Your goal is to sign some deals, and get some reference customers, and get some validation and get some revenue. That, if you don't do that, your start up is toast. So in light of that, it's really surprising how many smart people will want to do ten rounds of document review, quibbling over the most minor points because of pride, because of intelligence, whatever. Make sure the agreement is the way you want it, but then sign it and move on. I've seen founders spend months quibbling over some indemnification clauses. And their business would have been way better off if they'd just signed the deal and moved onto the next one. So, that's one closing trap you can fall into.

但这些资源从未公开过。如果你不是 YC 的一部分，你就得自己摸索。我真正感到兴奋的一点是，作为本次演讲的一部分，YC 已经同意开源他们的交易文件。所以 YC 创始人过去使用的这些文件现在将对所有人开放。希望这永远不会成为任何人想要为自己的初创公司进行销售的障碍。你们现在有了一些很棒的文件。关于这一点我要说的另一件事，也是我看到很多聪明人犯错的地方，就是你必须记住你的目标是什么。你的目标是签署一些交易，获得一些参考客户，获得一些验证和收入。如果你不这样做，你的初创公司就完蛋了。考虑到这一点，令人惊讶的是有多少聪明人想要进行十轮文件审查，因为骄傲、因为聪明或其他原因而纠结于最细微的细节。确保协议符合你的要求，但之后就签署并继续前进。我见过创始人花费数月时间在一些赔偿条款上纠缠不休。如果他们当时直接签署协议并转向下一个，他们的业务本会好得多。所以，这是一个你可能陷入的成交陷阱。

I have two more points. If you're ambitious, when somebody says that to you, what you want to hear is, "Oh, well I can build that feature. Great. I'll build that feature and then they're going to use my product." But the problem is, it almost never works that way. In fact, when somebody tells you that they would use your product but it's just missing this one feature, I would almost map that to a pass in your mind. Because nine times out of ten, if you actually build that feature and go back to them, then there'd be one more feature, or there'd be some other reason that they're not using the product. So, if somebody says to you, "Hey, I want to, but there's this one thing that's preventing us from using your product," I would do one of two things. One: say, "Well that's great. Let's sign an agreement and we'll put in the agreement that we're going to build this feature." In which case, you know that if you build it, you're off to the races. Or more commonly, what we did at Clever was we would say, "That's great. We're going to wait to see if we hear that demand from more customers." And then once you have a lot of customers requesting it, then you should build it regardless. Then you don't have to worry about doing something that's customer one-off, which is what you really want to avoid. So, don't fall into this trap; it happens all the time.

我还有两点要补充。如果你有雄心壮志，当有人对你说这些话时，你希望听到的是："哦，我可以开发那个功能。太好了。我会开发那个功能，然后他们就会使用我的产品。"但问题是，实际情况几乎从来不是这样。事实上，当有人告诉你他们愿意使用你的产品，只是缺少某个功能时，我几乎会把这当作拒绝的信号。因为十有八九，如果你真的开发了那个功能再去找他们，他们又会提出另一个功能需求，或者找出其他不使用产品的理由。所以，如果有人对你说："嘿，我想用，但有某个因素阻碍我们使用你的产品"，我会采取以下两种做法之一：第一种是说："太好了。我们签个协议吧，在协议中注明我们将开发这个功能。"这样，你就知道如果开发了这个功能，事情就能顺利推进。或者更常见的做法是，我们在 Clever 时会说："太好了。我们会等待观察是否从更多客户那里听到这个需求。"一旦有很多客户都提出这个需求，那么无论如何你都应该开发它。这样你就不必担心为单个客户定制功能，而这正是你真正想要避免的情况。所以，不要陷入这个陷阱，这种情况经常发生。

And the other trap I would highly, highly recommend you try to avoid is the free trial trap. Because this happens all the time. People go down this path with a customer, it seems really exciting. And then the customer says, oh, well can I get a free trial? And you can't blame them. That's a totally reasonable thing to ask for. But the problem is, when you're starting a startup you need revenue, you need validation, you need users, you need commitment. And free trials get you none of those things. So you go, you do all this work, and if you end up with a free trial, unfortunately, you haven't made as much progress as you think. It's actually terrible. You think you've made progress. But really, at the end of the free trial, you're going to have to sell them all over again. So the way I handle this that has worked really well, is when somebody says, can I get a free trial? You say, well we don't do free trials. But what we can do is we do annual agreements here. And what we'll do is for the first 30 or 60 days, if for any reason you're not happy, you can opt out. And that's a way to get you the things that you need, while giving them the comfort that they might need to take a chance on a startup. So that minor change actually makes a night and day difference when you're thinking about these things.

我要强烈建议你尽量避免的另一个陷阱是免费试用陷阱。因为这种情况经常发生。人们与客户走这条路时，看起来非常令人兴奋。然后客户说，哦，我能获得免费试用吗？你不能责怪他们。这完全是个合理的请求。但问题在于，当你创办初创公司时，你需要收入、需要验证、需要用户、需要承诺。而免费试用无法带给你任何这些东西。所以你投入所有工作，如果最终只获得免费试用，不幸的是，你取得的进展并不如你想象的那么大。这实际上很糟糕。你以为自己取得了进展。但实际上，在免费试用结束时，你将不得不重新向他们推销。我处理这个问题的方法非常有效，当有人问能否获得免费试用时，你可以说我们不提供免费试用。但我们可以做的是签订年度协议。我们会在前 30 或 60 天内，如果出于任何原因您不满意，您可以退出。这样既能满足你的需求，又能给他们尝试初创公司所需的安心感。所以这个微小改变在你考虑这些事情时，实际上会产生天壤之别。

Your goal is to not have to do things that scale. In fact, you can purposely do unscalable things to try and get early customers. That's the fun of it. But the other thing that I think is really important to keep in mind is, once you've done this enough, what you should start thinking about is what aspects of this are repeatable and what aspects of this are we going to scale further.

你的目标是不必做那些需要规模化的事情。事实上，你可以特意做一些不可规模化的事情来尝试获取早期客户。这正是其中的乐趣所在。但我认为另一个非常重要的思考点是，当你在这方面做得足够多时，应该开始考虑哪些方面是可复制的，哪些方面是我们需要进一步扩展的。

Cristoph Janz has this really great blog post online about the five ways to build a $100 million company. He talks about having a thousand customers buy a product that costs $100,000, or having 10,000 customers buy a product that costs $10,000, or having 100,000 customers buy a product that costs $1,000. And even though you don't need to know on day one which bucket you're going to fall into, most companies do fall into one of these buckets.

克里斯托夫·詹兹在网上发表了一篇非常精彩的博客文章，讲述了打造价值 1 亿美元公司的五种方法。他谈到可以让一千个客户购买价值 10 万美元的产品，或者让一万个客户购买价值 1 万美元的产品，或者让十万个客户购买价值 1 千美元的产品。尽管你不需要在第一天就知道自己会属于哪一类，但大多数公司确实都会落入这些类别之一。

And so you should start thinking about that as you're doing this. If you want to be in the elephant category of $100,000 product, that's great. You're going to have a really high touch sale cycle, and that's fine. That's sales force. That's work day, that's great. But if you think you're going to be a rabbit and sell products for $1,000 a year to businesses, and your sales process involves flying out to see them three times and eight demos and three months of redlining, then you probably have to rethink something.

因此，在进行这个过程时，你应该开始思考这个问题。如果你想成为 10 万美元产品的大象类别，这很好。你将需要一个高度接触的销售周期，这也没问题。这就是销售团队的工作方式，这很好。但如果你认为自己会成为兔子，向企业销售每年 1,000 美元的产品，而你的销售流程需要三次出差拜访、八次演示和三个月的红线谈判，那么你可能需要重新考虑某些事情。

And so I see a lot of startups most commonly in that, who want to be the rabbits and sell for a low priced product to businesses, not thinking about how to do it in a scalable way. And that's one area where you can get underwater, or it just forces you to increase your prices.

因此，我经常看到很多初创公司处于这种情况，他们想要成为兔子，向企业销售低价产品，却没有考虑如何以可扩展的方式进行。这是一个可能陷入困境的领域，或者会迫使你提高价格。

So this is how I think about different businesses. And it'll be helpful for you when you can get started, and once you've done enough of the sales to say, okay, where am I? And the corollary to that is, how do I have to price my product to be a viable business? So those are some of the things that I figured out along the way building sales now at a few different companies. And specifically on this very narrow stage of zero to 1 million. After you get to 1 million, you'll find there's a million blog posts about how to get from 5 million to 50 million, or 10 million to 100 million. But this zero to one step, I wanted to focus the presentation on that today. Because there's not as much written about it and it is something that I think is very opaque to a lot of founders. I figured this out just by doing it. And I'm confident that if you're starting a company, you can too. If for whatever reason you would like to do what I did and join a startup that's figured it out and hone your skills and hone your craft, we are hiring at Clever, so that's an option. But even if you do want to start your own company and you have questions about sales, I put my e-mail address up here. And feel free to reach out at any time, I'm happy to help. So thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, that was awesome. All right.

这就是我思考不同业务的方式。当你可以开始创业时，当你完成足够的销售来评估自己的位置时，这对你会很有帮助。其必然推论是，我必须如何为产品定价才能成为一个可行的业务？这些是我在几家不同公司建立销售过程中总结出的一些经验。特别关注从零到一百万这个非常狭窄的阶段。当你达到一百万后，你会发现有无数关于如何从五百万到五千万，或者从一千万到一个亿的博客文章。但今天我想重点讨论这个从零到一的阶段。因为关于这方面的资料相对较少，而且我认为这对很多创始人来说是非常模糊的领域。我是通过实践才弄明白的。我相信如果你正在创业，你也能做到。如果出于任何原因，你想像我一样加入一家已经解决这个问题的初创公司，磨练你的技能和技艺，我们 Clever 正在招聘，这是一个选择。但即使你想创办自己的公司并对销售有疑问，我在这里留下了我的电子邮箱地址。随时欢迎联系，我很乐意提供帮助。谢谢。非常感谢。是的，讲得太棒了。好的。

So now, we're going to talk about a little bit more detail on how to raise money. Michael Seibel is first going to talk about how to have a pitch, and then Dalton and Qasar will do investor role playing.

> > Yeah, sure. My name is Michael Seibel. I'm a current YC partner. I've started two companies. One was called Justin TV, which ended up selling to Amazon. The other was called SocialCam, which sold to Auto Desk. What I really wanted to do was break down and demystify the process of creating a pitch, because I think what happens too often when I see companies come to talk to me is that they don't know how to simply explain what they do and then ask for money.

现在，我们将更详细地讨论如何筹集资金。迈克尔·塞贝尔将首先介绍如何进行项目路演，然后道尔顿和卡萨尔将进行投资者角色扮演。

> > 好的。我叫迈克尔·塞贝尔，是 YC 的现任合伙人。我创办过两家公司，一家是 Justin TV，最终卖给了亚马逊；另一家是 SocialCam，卖给了欧特克。我真正想做的是分解并揭开制作路演稿的神秘面纱，因为根据我的观察，很多来找我洽谈的公司往往不知道如何简明扼要地说明他们的业务内容并提出融资需求。

Mind blowingly new, and that's basically what you have to do as a founder. So we're going to go over four things. The first is what your 30 second pitch is. This you need to be armed with constantly. This is basically how you talk about your company. This is magic. Whether you're talking to people who want to give you money or don't want to give you money, you're talking to your parents. This is your go to.

令人惊叹的创新，这基本上就是作为创始人必须做的事情。我们将讨论四个要点。首先是你的 30 秒电梯演讲。这是你需要时刻准备的。这基本上就是你如何介绍公司的方式。这很神奇。无论你是在和愿意投资的人交谈，还是和不愿投资的人交谈，甚至是在和父母聊天时，这都是你的必备技能。

This is how you make it super simple. Usually what we tell people is apply the mom test. If in one sentence you cannot tell your mom what you do, then rework the sentence. There is a one sentence explanation that your mom, or your dad is going to understand. So really, really start there, and it's okay if you use really basic language. It's okay if you're saying hey we're Air B and B, and we allow you to rent out the extra room in your house. That's simple, right? You don't have to say we're Air B and B and we're a marketplace for space. I don't know what that is. And it's going to require more time. So use simple language. Very, very important.

这就是让它变得超级简单的方法。通常我们告诉人们要应用"妈妈测试"。如果你不能用一句话告诉你妈妈你是做什么的，那就重新组织这句话。总有一句话的解释能让你的妈妈或爸爸理解。所以真的要从这里开始，使用非常基础的语言也没关系。如果你说"我们是 Air B and B，我们允许你出租房子里的空余房间"，这样也没问题。这很简单，对吧？你不必说"我们是 Air B and B，我们是空间交易市场"。我不知道那是什么意思。而且那需要更多时间。所以使用简单的语言。这一点非常非常重要。

We have this number of sales, this amount of revenue, this number of users. Very simple. If you can't speak to traction in terms of pre-launch, you need to convince the investor that you're moving extremely quickly. So, the team started working in January, by March, we launched a beta, by April, we launched our product. Convince the investors that you guys are moving fast. That this isn't some long slog that you guys aren't thinking about this like a big cooperation. You're thinking about it like a startup where you can move fast and make mistakes. That's all you have to do in 30 seconds. Three sentences. From that basis you should be able to start a conversation about your company. From that basis I understand exactly what you do. You have no idea how valuable it is to be able to explain to someone what you do in 30 seconds, so really internalize that. If you take nothing else away, that's going to help you. Two minute pitch. Now you've got someone you actually have to convince of something. Maybe even someone you have to ask for money. So, I like to add four additional components and these also go by very quick. The first is unique insight. If you talk to VCs they'll say stuff like, what's your secret sauce, what's your competitive advantage, what's your unique insight? It's all the same thing. When I think about unique insight, what I think about is here's your opportunity to tell me something that I don't know. Here's your opportunity to tell me something that the biggest players in the market you're trying to enter don't know.

我们有这样的销售额、这样的收入和这样的用户数量。非常简单。如果你无法用发布前的数据来证明吸引力，你需要说服投资者你正在快速推进。团队在一月份开始工作，到三月份我们发布了测试版，到四月份我们推出了产品。说服投资者你们正在快速行动。这不是一个漫长的过程，你们不是像大公司那样思考问题。你们像初创公司一样思考，可以快速行动并犯错。这就是你在 30 秒内需要做的全部。三句话。基于此，你应该能够开始关于你公司的对话。基于此，我完全理解你在做什么。你根本不知道能够在 30 秒内向某人解释你在做什么有多么宝贵，所以要真正内化这一点。如果你什么都不记得，这一点将会帮助你。两分钟的推介。现在你有了一个真正需要说服的人。甚至可能是你需要向其要钱的人。所以，我喜欢添加四个额外的组成部分，这些也会很快过去。第一个是独特见解。如果你与风险投资人交谈，他们会问诸如你的秘密武器是什么、你的竞争优势是什么、你的独特见解是什么？这些都是同一个意思。当我思考独特见解时，我认为这是你告诉我一些我不知道的事情的机会。这是你告诉我你试图进入的市场中最大参与者不知道的事情的机会。

This is the ah-ha moment, and you'd better have it down in two sentences. The ah-ha moment is when you crystallize all of the reasons why you're going to beat the competitors, or the really intelligent thought that got this business started. You can see whether it's happening when you're saying it. That's why I like two sentences, so you get in and out fast. If I look at you and I'm like "huh", then you've nailed it. If I look at you and I'm like "I already knew that", then you didn't nail it. If I look at you and I just don't understand what you're talking about, you definitely didn't nail it. Practice that unique insight in your two-minute pitch. You're only going to get two sentences to get that out there, so it can't be complicated, and that's basically the theme of this whole thing. Next, how do you make money? I see so many founders run away from this question because they think if they say "advertising", people will think it's stupid. Just say it. Don't run away. If it's advertising, say advertising. Facebook's a massive advertising business, and so is Google. If it's direct sales, say direct sales. If it's a game and you're selling in-app add-ons, that's fine. Just say it. Don't run away from this sentence. It only has to be one sentence long.

这就是顿悟时刻，你最好用两句话把它说清楚。顿悟时刻就是你提炼出所有能击败竞争对手的理由，或是启动这项业务的真正智慧想法。当你说出来时，就能看出是否达到了效果。这就是为什么我喜欢两句话，这样你能快速切入主题。如果我看你的反应是"嗯"，那说明你说到点子上了。如果我看你的反应是"这个我早就知道了"，那说明你没说到位。如果我看你时完全不明白你在说什么，那你肯定没表达清楚。在你的两分钟路演中练习这种独特见解。你只有两句话来表达这个观点，所以不能太复杂，这基本上就是整个演讲的主题。接下来，你如何赚钱？我看到很多创始人都回避这个问题，因为他们觉得如果说"广告"，人们会觉得这很愚蠢。直接说出来，不要回避。如果是广告，就说广告。Facebook 就是一个庞大的广告业务，谷歌也是。如果是直销，就说直销。如果是游戏，你在销售应用内附加内容，那也没问题。直接说出来，不要回避这句话。它只需要一句话的长度。

or people you actually care about, anything you understand or don't do well, run advertising, maybe some virtual goods. We're going to figure out how to do this, and maybe this, and maybe this. Well, now you're saying nothing. Now you've told me you have no idea how you want to monetize this. This was a checkmark that I just wanted to write, oh, they know how they're going to monetize. Instead, I'm writing a big question mark. So, do the thing that everyone else in your industry does to monetize 95% of the time. Say it and move on. Like, it's totally okay, no one's going to hold your feet to the fire and say three years later, you didn't monetize this way. But it's much better to be clear and concise than it is to start spouting out every single way your company can make money.

对于你真正关心的人群、你理解或不擅长的领域，可以通过广告投放或虚拟商品等方式变现。我们会想办法解决这个问题，尝试各种可能性。但你现在等于什么都没说。你实际上告诉我你根本不知道如何将这项业务货币化。我原本想打个勾，觉得你们清楚盈利模式。结果却画上了一个大大的问号。你应该采用行业内 95%企业都在使用的盈利方式。明确说出来然后继续推进。这完全没问题，没人会三年后揪着你不放，指责你没有按当初说的方式盈利。清晰简洁地说明远比罗列公司所有可能的盈利方式要好得多。

The next one is team. I think that this answer is actually really clear. I think you're trying to do two things. If your team has done something particularly impressive, you need to call that out. We were the founders of PayPal, probably want to say that. We were the founders of Amazon, might, probably want to say that. So if you guys have done something that has made investors money, you want to say that. If not, then please don't go on about the awards your team has won, or the PhDs or the I don't care, I don't care. What we want to hear is how many founders. Hopefully between two and four. What we want to hear is how many of them are technical. How many engineers versus business people? Hopefully it's 50 50 or more engineers. We want to hear is that how long have you guys known each other.

下一个是团队部分。我认为这个问题的答案其实非常明确。我觉得你需要做两件事。如果你的团队有过特别出色的成就，一定要重点强调。比如曾是 PayPal 的创始人，就应该说出来。曾是亚马逊的创始人，也应该说出来。如果你们的团队曾为投资者创造过收益，就要明确说明。如果没有这样的经历，请不要过多谈论团队获得的奖项、博士学位等我不关心的内容。我们想了解的是创始人的数量。最好是两到四人。我们想知道其中有多少技术背景的成员。工程师和商务人员的比例如何？最好是各占一半或工程师居多。我们还想知道你们彼此认识多久了。

We don't want to hear you guys met at a founders' dating event three days ago. Ideally, you've known each other either personally or professionally for at least six months. We want to hear is that you're all working full-time. It's really helpful, we're all committed to this business. And what we want to hear is how you met. That's it. You can get in and out of that two sentences very easy.

我们不想听到你们三天前在创始人相亲活动上认识。理想情况下，你们应该已经认识至少六个月，无论是私人关系还是专业往来。我们想听到的是你们都在全职工作。这很有帮助，我们都对这个事业全心投入。我们想听的是你们如何相识。就这样。用两句话就能轻松说完。

Your only way to build that's too, that's all your pitch. Done, like, game over. Now you let them talk. So, when to fundraise? I think this is so important. Right, you've got this little growth graph here. Investors like to invest based on traction. And so literally it's always better to raise money when you've got more traction than less. Often times though, you guys'll be in a situation where you're just starting. Or maybe you just launched. So what you need to do is you need to think about how do you flip the equation? Your entire mindset should be, typically you are the ones asking investors for money and therefore they are strong and you're weak. How do you create a scenario where you are strong and they are weak? Right? That's where you want to be fundraising. So first, how do you know that you're strong? If investors are asking you to give you money, you're strong. That might be a good time to start fundraising. If investors aren't asking about giving you money, are you talking to people about your startup? Or are you running super stealth? If you're talking to people about your startup and you're getting the word out, either that's through the press or just through talking to your friends or people you know doing startups, that's a good way to kind of start feeding that. The second thing is have you created a plan so that you can launch and grow without needing to raise a bunch of money? 95% of the startups that I meet can get a product to market with a very, very little bit of money. So never put the investor in the ultimate position of power.

你构建的唯一方式就是这些，这就是你的全部推销内容。完成，就像游戏结束一样。现在你让他们说话。那么，何时进行融资？我认为这一点非常重要。没错，你这里有一个小小的增长图表。投资者喜欢基于发展势头进行投资。所以实际上，当你拥有更多发展势头时融资总是比势头不足时更好。但很多时候，你们会处于刚刚起步的情况。或者也许你刚刚推出产品。所以你需要做的是思考如何扭转这个等式？你的整个思维方式应该是，通常你是向投资者要钱的一方，因此他们强势而你弱势。如何创造一个你强势而他们弱势的场景？对吧？这就是你想要进行融资的状态。首先，你如何知道自己处于强势地位？如果投资者主动要求给你钱，你就处于强势。这可能是开始融资的好时机。如果投资者没有主动提出给你钱，你是否在与人谈论你的初创公司？还是你在进行超级隐秘运营？如果你在与人谈论你的初创公司并且正在传播消息，无论是通过媒体还是仅仅通过与朋友或你认识的创业人士交流，这都是开始培养这种势头的好方法。第二件事是你是否制定了计划，以便你可以在不需要筹集大量资金的情况下推出产品并实现增长？我遇到的 95%的初创公司都能用非常非常少的资金将产品推向市场。所以永远不要让投资者处于最终权力地位。

We can't do anything until you give us money. You always want to flip it around. You always want it to be, these things moving. We all left our jobs, we're all working full time. And it's moving, if you want to jump on great, if not. There are a lot of angel investors. That's the attitude you want to have. That's the confidence you want to have. If you need money early, always plan for needing less money. And always be able to show that you've got a fully committed team that's working fast. That's going to be how you gain an advantage when you can't show traction. If you can show that investor that you haven't launched yet, but you've done eight months of work in one month, or two months. That you've got a great team that have all quit their jobs and they're totally committed. You get some of that advantage back. But you don't get all of the advantage unless you're launched and growing. So something to keep in mind.

在你们给我们钱之前，我们什么都做不了。你们总是想要扭转局面。你们总是希望事情能够推进。我们都辞去了工作，都在全职投入。项目正在推进，如果你们想加入很好，如果不愿意也没关系。有很多天使投资人。这就是你们应该持有的态度。这就是你们应该具备的信心。如果你们早期需要资金，总是要计划需要更少的资金。并且要能够展示你们拥有一个全力以赴、快速工作的团队。当你们无法展示业务进展时，这就是你们获得优势的方式。如果你们能向投资人展示虽然尚未正式推出，但已经在一个月或两个月内完成了八个月的工作量。展示你们拥有一支优秀团队，所有人都辞去了工作并全力以赴。这样你们就能重新获得部分优势。但除非你们已经正式推出并实现增长，否则无法获得全部优势。这是需要牢记的一点。

Finally, how to set up investor meetings. This is really, really simple, but I'm surprised at how many companies don't get this right. The first is you want a warm introduction from another entrepreneur, preferably, or a previous investor of yours. That's where you want to start. If someone who has passed on your company as an investor offers you to make introductions, that's kryptonite. Don't touch that. So first, warm introduction. Very simple, you don't want to cold call these people, you don't want to bum rush these people. The credibility of the person who's introducing you to an investor is a big part on whether the investor will take that meeting. Second, think in parallel.

最后，如何安排投资人会议。这其实非常简单，但我惊讶于很多公司都做不好这一点。首先，你们需要通过另一位创业者，最好是你们之前的投资人进行热情引荐。这是你们应该开始的地方。如果有人作为投资人拒绝了你们的公司，却主动提出要帮你们引荐，这就像是氪石一样有害。不要碰这种情况。所以第一点，热情引荐。非常简单，你们不应该给这些人打陌生电话，也不应该强行接近这些人。引荐你们给投资人的那个人的可信度，在很大程度上决定了投资人是否会接受这次会议。第二点，要并行思考。

So many people that I meet will run the fundraising this super slow process. We met with one guy this week, we're going to schedule a meeting with another guy next week, another guy three weeks from now. When you're fundraising you're on. It's a sprint, it's not a marathon. So you want to schedule all of your meetings during the same week. It's extremely hard to do, but here's one trick that I love. Tell when you're emailing investors, you're getting those warm intros, the investors email you back. You say, hey, we'd love to set up a meeting but we're building like crazy for the next two weeks. So can we set it up in that third week? Right? So then, you've e-mailed every one that, right? So every one schedules that meeting three weeks out. It's better for them because their calendar's open. It's better for you because you've got all your meetings in one week. And also, what did you do? You hinted, hey, I'm not desperate for the money. We're building. Like, I could meet you in three weeks. But we're building. We're busy. Like, it's signalling all of the right things. So that's the best way to kind of go about how you're going to do that. The last thing is one team member should be invested in fundraising full time. It shouldn't be something that takes over the whole company, because it's very, very distracting. So with that, let's kick it off to the next part of this.

我遇到的很多人都会把融资过程搞得非常缓慢。我们这周见了一个人，下周要安排和另一个人见面，三周后还要见另一个人。当你进行融资时，你必须全力以赴。这是一场短跑，不是马拉松。所以你应该把所有会议都安排在同一周进行。这非常困难，但我有一个很喜欢的技巧。当你给投资人发邮件时，通过熟人介绍，投资人回复你邮件时，你可以说：我们很乐意安排会议，但接下来两周我们正疯狂地进行产品开发。所以我们能否安排在第三周见面？对吧？这样你就给所有人都发了邮件，对吧？于是每个人都会把会议安排在三周后。这对他们更好，因为他们的日程表是开放的。对你更好，因为你把所有会议都集中在一周内。而且，你做了什么？你暗示了：我并不是急需这笔钱。我们正在开发产品。比如，我可以三周后见你。但我们正在开发。我们很忙。这传递了所有正确的信号。这就是处理这件事的最佳方式。最后一点是，应该有一个团队成员全职负责融资。它不应该占据整个公司的时间，因为这会非常非常分散注意力。那么，让我们开始下一部分吧。

Hi, my name is Dalton Caldwell. I'm one of the partners at YC, and one of the things that we're going to do today real quick is a mock pitch. First of all, I know this is a bit contrived, but this is in the format of a college class. We're going to do our best to have fun and demonstrate what it's like. I realize there's a million reasons why you could say this isn't realistic of what a pitch is really like, but again, there's a lot that we can show you. Just in terms of my background over my career, I've raised 85 million over several companies, so I've sat in a lot of investor meetings. I'm going to be pulling as many things as I can. So again, we're just going to try to show you something to talk to and use it as a learning session. You already did your intro earlier, Caspar, right? I've done a couple startups. So we're going to do two pitches, and we're going to go through them pretty fast. As Michael said, these tend to go fast. So let's dive into the first one. Okay, so Caspar, I understand you're coming to pitch me. What can you tell me about what you do? So we're building a communication platform that will allow businesses and consumers to collaborate on one single platform rather than the kind of fractured state that they're in right now. Think about WhatsApp or Snapchat that's for consumers. We want to do that for businesses.

大家好，我是道尔顿·考德威尔。我是 YC 的合伙人之一，今天我们要快速进行的是模拟路演。首先，我知道这有点刻意，但这是采用大学课堂的形式。我们会尽力让过程有趣，并展示路演的真实场景。我明白你们有无数理由可以说这不像是真实的路演，但我们可以展示很多内容。就我的职业背景而言，我通过几家公司筹集了 8500 万美元，因此参加过很多投资者会议。我会尽可能多地分享经验。所以，我们只是想给大家提供一些讨论素材，把这当作一次学习机会。卡斯帕，你之前已经做过自我介绍了吧？我创办过几家初创公司。我们将进行两场路演，进度会很快。正如迈克尔所说，这类演示通常节奏很快。让我们开始第一场吧。好的，卡斯帕，我知道你是来向我做路演的。能介绍一下你们在做什么吗？我们正在打造一个沟通平台，让企业和消费者能够在单一平台上协作，而不是像现在这样处于割裂状态。想想面向消费者的 WhatsApp 或 Snapchat，我们想为企业打造类似平台。

I'm one of the founders. I have to do this with a straight face. What that means is we want to enable consumers to talk to businesses. And that's really the goal of our startup business. I still don't understand who uses this and what does this product do. It's for consumers and businesses, a messaging product. It allows consumers to send messages. Why would a consumer want to use your product? Because they want to message a business.

我是创始人之一。我必须一本正经地做这件事。这意味着我们想让消费者能够与企业对话。而这正是我们初创企业的真正目标。我仍然不明白谁使用这个产品以及这个产品是做什么的。这是一个面向消费者和企业的通讯产品。它允许消费者发送消息。消费者为什么会想使用你的产品？因为他们想给企业发消息。

I'm one of the far, what insights you've had from. Yes. The consumers are sending messages to these businesses, and we think that's great. So, and these businesses are responding to the messages, and we think that's, you know, I don't think that's obvious that that would happen. So, can you tell me about what your business model is, and how. Yeah, so we charge businesses like a monthly rate. We haven't precisely figured out what that is we've, we've, right now we're free for the few hundred companies we're in right now. But we're looking to probably do a monthly something. How much do you think a business will be willing to pay? We think certainly 10 to $15,000 a month. Okay so, so anyway could you tell me a little bit about your team and who you have working on this. Yeah, there's we have five founders technically I'm the only one who's full time right now the, we're raising money so we can get, you know, the rest of the team on board yeah. That's this. Or can any of the founders program, or, or. Yeah, yeah. I mean we have, I mean one of them is a bio PhD but he's like he's really picked up coding. The, the. I mean, I'm a Python developer, I did learn Python the hard way. Oh, look at the time. Well, it's been really great meeting you. Please keep me in the loop, this sounds fantastic. I'll send you an update. Great. That was awful. So let's just go through, so. That was obviously not strong. So let's just talk about some of the mistakes.

我是其中一员，你从中学到了什么见解。是的。消费者正在向这些企业发送信息，我们认为这很棒。所以，这些企业正在回应这些信息，我们认为这，你知道，我不认为这种情况是显而易见的。那么，你能告诉我你的商业模式是什么，以及如何运作。是的，我们向企业收取类似月费的费用。我们还没有完全确定具体金额，目前对我们合作的几百家公司是免费的。但我们可能考虑按月收费。你认为企业愿意支付多少？我们确信每月 1 万到 1.5 万美元。好的，那么你能告诉我一些关于你的团队情况以及谁在负责这个项目。是的，我们有五位创始人，严格来说目前只有我是全职的，我们正在筹集资金以便让其他团队成员加入。就是这样。或者任何创始人都能编程，或者。是的，是的。我的意思是，我们有一位生物学博士，但他确实学会了编程。这个，这个。我的意思是，我是一名 Python 开发人员，我是通过艰难的方式学会 Python 的。哦，看看时间。很高兴见到你。请随时告诉我最新进展，这听起来很棒。我会给你发送更新。太好了。那太糟糕了。那么我们来回顾一下，所以。那显然不够有力。那么我们来谈谈一些错误。

I'm one of the far. First of all, you need to make sure the person you're talking to knows what you do. This just seems really simple, but it's not. Yeah, this seems simple, but it's not. So many times, people get flustered. They get nervous, and they start talking really fast. And there's no way you're ever going to convince anyone of anything if they don't know even what your app actually is. You have to know your numbers obviously. If you're very vague or evasive, like don't even have the meeting. If you don't feel comfortable telling an investor what your numbers are, don't even meet with them. It means you're not ready yet, right? For market size, try to give some plausible bottom-up analysis and don't just name-drop big companies that aren't even really related to what you're doing. People tend to do that a lot. Try to have insights, try to convince me that there's something that I don't already know about the market that I learn talking to you, rather than just what everyone knows about what the market is. Right, I learned nothing during that particular pitch. Also, the team's just like, why are you working on this, why are you suited for it is a good thing to do. And finally, he didn't drive the conversation anywhere. Obviously that went poorly, and he just let the conversation flail around until I cut the meeting because we ran out of time as fast as I could. So anyway, that was not a good pitch. So let's try that again. Okay, all right. Let's do this. Okay.

我是其中之一。首先，你需要确保与你交谈的人了解你的工作内容。这看起来很简单，但实际上并非如此。是的，这看似简单，但实则不然。很多时候，人们会变得慌乱。他们紧张不安，开始语速过快。如果对方连你的应用到底是什么都不知道，你根本无法说服任何人任何事情。显然，你必须清楚自己的数据。如果你含糊其辞或回避问题，那干脆不要开会。如果你不情愿告诉投资者你的数据，那就不要与他们见面。这意味着你还没有准备好，对吧？关于市场规模，尝试提供一些合理的自下而上分析，不要只是提及那些与你所做之事并不真正相关的大公司。人们经常这样做。尝试提供独到见解，努力让我相信通过与你交谈，我能了解到一些关于市场的新知，而不仅仅是众所周知的市场信息。没错，在那次路演中我一无所获。此外，关于团队，解释你为何从事这项工作、为何适合这项工作是很重要的。最后，他完全没有引导对话方向。显然那次表现很糟糕，他只是让对话漫无目的地进行，直到我尽快结束了会议，因为我们时间不够了。总之，那是一次糟糕的路演。让我们再试一次。好的，没问题。我们开始吧。好的。

I'm one of the founders. First of all, can you just tell me a little about what you guys do? Yes, we're a messaging product. We allow you to essentially message a location. When you walk into a Crate and Barrel, you can send the Crate and Barrel manager a message like, "Hey, there's puke in the hallway." Or if you're in the airport, "I'm trying to find this specific gate because I'm not at this airport. Where's the terminal for Virgin?" Or if you're at Target, "What aisle?" Okay, so is this a mobile app or how do I use it? Yeah, so on the consumer side we have iOS and Android apps, but really getting consumers to download apps is obviously very difficult. I don't usually just download apps to send a message. In most businesses we have a call to action which says, "Text the owner directly." We've tested actually a bunch of copy that works the best in small print. The messages are anonymous, which also lowers the barrier to entry. I think the most counterintuitive thing we've learned in the kind of launch that we've had, where in 350 locations in the Bay we've been doing this for about three months with about 11% weekly growth rate in terms of acquiring businesses, is will people send messages when they walk in.

我是创始人之一。首先，你能简单介绍一下你们是做什么的吗？是的，我们是一个消息产品。我们基本上允许您向某个位置发送消息。当您走进 Crate and Barrel 商店时，您可以给 Crate and Barrel 经理发送消息，比如"嘿，走廊里有呕吐物"。或者如果您在机场，"我正在找这个特定的登机口，因为我不在这个机场。维珍航空的航站楼在哪里？"或者如果您在 Target 商店，"哪个通道？"好的，那么这是一个移动应用程序吗？我该如何使用它？是的，在消费者方面，我们有 iOS 和 Android 应用程序，但让消费者下载应用程序显然非常困难。我通常不会仅仅为了发送消息而下载应用程序。在大多数企业中，我们有一个行动号召，上面写着"直接给业主发短信"。我们实际上测试了很多在小字印刷中效果最好的文案。消息是匿名的，这也降低了使用门槛。我认为在我们进行的这种发布中最违反直觉的事情是——在湾区的 350 个地点，我们已经进行了大约三个月，在获取业务方面每周增长率约为 11%——人们走进来时是否会发送消息。
So first of all, you need to... I mean that sounds kind of vague, so what we allow you to do is essentially message. I'm trying to find this specific gate because I'm not at this airport, where is, you know, where's a terminal for Virgin? Or if you're at Target, what aisle? In most businesses we have a call to action. But the most counter-intuitive thing that we learned, because we weren't actually sure, is, will people send messages when they walk into and they do.

首先，你需要……我的意思是这听起来有点模糊，所以我们允许你做的本质上就是发送消息。我想找到这个特定的登机口，因为我不在这个机场，维珍航空的航站楼在哪里？或者如果你在塔吉特超市，在哪个过道？在大多数业务中，我们都有行动号召。但我们学到的最违反直觉的事情，因为我们实际上不确定，就是人们走进来时会不会发送消息——而他们确实会。

What's the number one type of message that people send? So originally, we started this product off thinking this is going to be in-location feedback. That was the premise, in-location feedback. What we found is more than half the messages are actually not about feedback at all. They ask things like: we were in this location in San Jose, this Kabob stand, father and son, it's just a take out place, and we saw messages that went through that said like are you hiring? And that's like very strange because you would think like why wouldn't you just ask the owner. But we realized that we know this is the owner, and the person who's walking in doesn't, and so they do prefer to actually just text the owner because they think that's an easier medium.

人们发送的第一类信息是什么？最初我们开发这个产品时认为这将用于位置反馈。这就是前提，位置反馈。但我们发现超过一半的信息实际上根本与反馈无关。他们会问这样的问题：我们在圣何塞的这个烤肉摊，父子经营，只是个外卖店，我们看到有人发信息问"你们在招聘吗？"这很奇怪，因为你会想为什么不直接问店主呢。但我们意识到我们知道这是店主，而进店的人并不知道，所以他们确实更倾向于直接给店主发短信，因为他们认为这是更便捷的沟通方式。

We're all technical, but we actually did all the sales because we learned a lot about how these businesses work. We actually come from a retail background. We originally built this product for large enterprise players like Starbucks and Walmart. But we recognize that closing those contracts, and our limited amount of runway wouldn't really be possible. So we wanted to get the product in the hands of users. So we did SMBs. And that's when we discovered hey, this like, this messaging product.

我们都有技术背景，但实际上我们承担了所有销售工作，因为我们深入了解了这些企业的运作方式。我们实际上来自零售行业背景。我们最初为大型企业客户如星巴克和沃尔玛开发了这个产品。但我们意识到，考虑到有限的资金储备，要达成这些合同实际上是不可能的。因此我们希望让用户能够使用这个产品。所以我们转向了中小企业市场。正是在那时我们发现了这个即时通讯产品。

Yes, so we get clear ways to make money, but I could see that. Can you tell me about your distribution strategy and also just a little bit about the team? So distribution, the thing that we learned in selling to these SMBs is it's really freaking hard. The formula LTV minus CPA, lifetime value minus cost price acquisition in SMB is never going to work out. And so we have two solutions. One is to go up market, like we originally planned, the Starbucks or Walmarts, or two is actually essentially pair with consumer facing companies like Yelp, Google, Facebook. Have you been talking to them? Do they actually want to do it? Yeah, so we've talked to Google and Facebook, we're meeting with Yelp. What we're basically want to do is every time you search for a business there should be a message button. We want to get consumers in the habit of knowing they can send, essentially a text message to any business. That can help us get broad distribution. Our real vision is to become kind of that infrastructure, that messaging infrastructure between consumers and business. If that doesn't work, let's say Google, Facebook, and Yelp don't want to give up that valuable property. It's really an ad unit. We do want to sell this as a feedback tool to large players. Can you tell me a little about the team? Yeah, there's three of us, all technical. Mike and I did a company before. Sunny is an ex-Google.

是的，我们有清晰的盈利途径，但我能理解这一点。能否谈谈您的分销策略，以及简单介绍一下团队情况？关于分销，我们在向这些中小企业销售过程中学到的是这真的非常困难。LTV 减去 CPA 的公式，即中小企业中的终身价值减去获客成本，是永远行不通的。因此我们有两个解决方案。一是向上游市场发展，如我们最初计划的星巴克或沃尔玛，二是实际上与面向消费者的公司合作，如 Yelp、谷歌、Facebook。你们和他们谈过了吗？他们真的愿意这样做吗？是的，我们已经与谷歌和 Facebook 谈过，正在安排与 Yelp 会面。我们基本上想要实现的是，每次您搜索企业时都应该有一个消息按钮。我们希望让消费者养成这样的习惯：知道他们基本上可以向任何企业发送短信。这有助于我们获得广泛的分销渠道。我们真正的愿景是成为那种基础设施，即消费者与企业之间的消息传递基础设施。如果这行不通，假设谷歌、Facebook 和 Yelp 不愿意放弃那些有价值的资产，这实际上是一个广告单元。我们确实希望将其作为反馈工具销售给大型企业。能简单介绍一下团队吗？是的，我们有三个人，都是技术背景。迈克和我之前创办过一家公司。桑尼是前谷歌员工。

We're running low on time. We come from retail. Our first startup was a failure. I don't know if that's good or bad, but we've worked together. We're all technical, we built everything ourselves and we sold everything ourselves. We've already had a couple conversations with your firm. We're raising 500,000 and 8.5 million convertible note. Of that 500, 250's committed by Mike Mapels, Eli Gill, and Aiden Sinkit. And Mike with Floodgate is willing to fill the round. We think you particularly, you and your firm can bring a lot to the team with your retail experience. Is this something that's interesting to you?

我们时间不多了。我们来自零售行业。我们的第一次创业失败了。我不知道这是好是坏，但我们已经合作过。我们都是技术人员，我们自己构建了一切，也自己销售了一切。我们已经与贵公司进行过几次交谈。我们正在筹集 50 万美元和 850 万美元的可转换债券。在这 50 万中，25 万已由 Mike Mapels、Eli Gill 和 Aiden Sinkit 承诺出资。而 Floodgate 的 Mike 愿意完成本轮融资。我们认为特别是您，您和贵公司凭借在零售方面的经验能为团队带来很多价值。您对这个项目感兴趣吗？

Our first startup had some key points to consider. It's important to actually tell a narrative that makes sense to people. You notice there were narratives there. He was talking about people and how they really use it. He was able to tie it down to the real world, which is good. He was able to demonstrate insights and actually tell me something I didn't already know about the market. There were some tidbits there. It was more of a collaborative meeting where it felt more like a conversation than just an interview. He actually asked for money, which is another key thing. At the end, you saw I could have easily just ended the conversation, but he did talk about fundraising as Michael mentioned. He was able to provide all the context and all the questions I would need to actually have a serious conversation with him. If he was cagey about it or shy about it and not clear on the numbers, there's a very high chance that I probably would have just ended the conversation due to time pressure.

我们的第一个初创公司有一些关键点需要考虑。重要的是要讲述一个对人们有意义的叙事。你会注意到那里有叙事存在。他在谈论人们以及他们实际如何使用它。他能够将其与现实世界联系起来，这很好。他能够展示见解，并告诉我一些我原本不了解的市场信息。那里有一些有价值的信息。这更像是一个协作会议，感觉更像是一场对话，而不仅仅是一次采访。他实际上提出了资金需求，这是另一个关键点。最后，你看到我本可以轻易结束对话，但他确实如迈克尔提到的那样讨论了融资。他能够提供所有背景信息和所有我需要的问题，以便与他进行严肃的对话。如果他对这件事遮遮掩掩或羞于启齿，并且对数字不清楚，那么由于时间压力，我很可能会直接结束对话。

So our first startup had some key points here. If they say we gotta keep talking to partners, I assume that's a no. And so, you do want to put some pressure. The way that you can do that is get deal heat. Deal heat is just a term which means there's a demand to be in your round. This is the easiest way and an important way to actually drive up price, etc. Due diligence on the investors. So let's say you have that 500,000 raise for your seed round on the 8.5 million like we used in this example. Due diligence investors. If you do find that the investor is actually not great, you can get Elaud, or Mike Maples, or whoever to actually fill the rest of the round. It's surprising to us how many entrepreneurs don't do this. You would actually spend a lot of time hiring somebody. You're selling a part of your company to somebody, you should know who you're selling it to. To make sure they're the type of people you think they are. And then last, know when to stop. So some founders get so good at fundraising they just want to do it all the time because it's much easier to do than actually building the company.

我们的第一个初创公司有一些关键要点。如果他们说需要继续与合作伙伴沟通，我认为这实际上就是拒绝。因此，你需要施加一些压力。实现这一目标的方法是制造交易热度。交易热度这个术语意味着市场对你的融资轮次有需求。这实际上是提高估值等的最简单且重要的方式。对投资者进行尽职调查。假设你像这个例子中一样，在 850 万美元估值下进行 50 万美元的种子轮融资。对投资者进行尽职调查。如果你确实发现投资者并不理想，你可以找 Elaud、Mike Maples 或其他投资者来填补剩余的融资额度。令我们惊讶的是，很多创业者都不这样做。招聘员工时你会花费大量时间，而你是将公司的一部分出售给他人，你应该知道你在卖给谁。确保他们是符合你预期的人。最后，要知道何时停止。有些创始人太擅长融资，以至于他们想一直这样做，因为这比实际经营公司要容易得多。

Yeah, you think they've applied to good schools and good jobs, and they just think fundraising is another application they can check off. Building a company is much more ambiguous. Anyways, that's the session. Fundraising is not the goal.

是的，你以为他们申请了好学校、好工作，就觉得筹款只是另一个可以打勾完成的任务。但创办公司要模糊得多。总之，这就是本次课程的内容。筹款不是最终目标。
