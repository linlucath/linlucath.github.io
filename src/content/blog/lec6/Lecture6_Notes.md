# Opening Remarks

Thank you all for coming today. I truly appreciate your presence here.

感谢各位今天的到来，能有这么多人出席让我倍感荣幸。

I've been following the lectures in this course, and I find the content absolutely amazing. Now, you're stuck with me for today's session – we'll see how that goes.

我一直在关注这门课程的讲座，发现内容非常精彩。今天轮到我来主持，希望不会让大家失望。

## Academic Background and Career Path

Unlike Paul's response during the Q&A session about studying physics if he were in college today, I actually pursued this path myself. I studied physics at Cambridge University, and I believe physics provides transferable skills that are extremely valuable in other fields.

与保罗在问答环节中说如果重新上大学会选择物理专业不同，我真的走了这条路。我在剑桥大学学习物理学，相信物理训练出的思维能力在其他领域都极其宝贵。

However, I recognize that physics isn't the primary reason you're here today. During my college years, I actually financed my education through online marketing, specifically direct sales and SEO strategies.

不过我知道，大家今天来这里不是为了听物理学的。实际上，我上大学时是靠网络营销来支付学费的，主要做直销和SEO优化。

# Early Internet Ventures

## Paper Airplane Website

In the 1990s, I created a paper airplane website that achieved a monopoly in the global niche market for paper airplanes. While this specialized market had limited long-term potential for startups, the experience taught me valuable SEO skills. During that era, Altavista was the dominant search engine, and the key SEO technique involved placing white text on a white background five pages below the fold. By repeating "paper airplanes" 20 to 30 times within this hidden text, I could secure the top ranking on Altavista. Mastering this straightforward SEO method proved to be an easily acquired skill.

上世纪90年代，我创建了一个纸飞机网站，在全球纸飞机这个小众市场形成了垄断地位。尽管这个细分市场对初创企业的长期发展潜力有限，但这段经历让我掌握了宝贵的SEO技能。当时Altavista是主流搜索引擎，关键的SEO技术是在页面折叠下方第五页设置白底白字。通过在隐藏文本中重复"纸飞机"20到30次，我就能在Altavista上获得最高排名。掌握这种简单的SEO方法成为一项容易习得的技能。

## College Experience

When I attended college as a physics major, I initially believed that paper airplanes would enhance my social appeal. However, as the most academically focused student in my physics class, I ultimately created a cocktail website instead. This project became my new platform for learning web development and digital marketing strategies.

上大学读物理专业时，我最初以为纸飞机能提升我的社交魅力。但作为班里最用功读书的学生，我最终还是做了一个鸡尾酒网站。这个项目成为了我学习网站开发和数字营销策略的新平台。

# Early Career Development

The program evolved into the largest cocktail website in the UK. This experience properly introduced me to SEO when Google first launched. With Google's emergence, we had to focus on page rank and building backlinks to our site. At that stage, securing one link from the Yahoo directory essentially guaranteed top placement in Google search results, especially when combined with hidden white text on a white background placed below the fold.

这个项目后来发展成了英国最大的鸡尾酒网站。谷歌刚推出时，这段经历让我真正接触到了搜索引擎优化。随着谷歌的崛起，我们必须关注网页排名和建立反向链接。在那个阶段，只要能从雅虎目录获得一个链接，再配合页面下方的隐藏白色文本，基本上就能保证在谷歌搜索结果中排名第一。

When Google launched AdWords, I began seriously learning comprehensive marketing strategies. This involved purchasing paid clicks from Google and reselling them to eBay through our affiliate program with a modest 20% margin. This venture propelled me into what is now commonly referred to as growth marketing or growth hacking, though I simply view it as effective marketing execution.

当谷歌推出AdWords时，我开始认真学习全面的营销策略。具体做法是从谷歌购买付费点击，然后通过我们的联盟计划以20%的微薄利润转售给eBay。这次创业把我带入了现在常说的增长营销或增长黑客领域，不过我只是把它看作有效的营销执行。

# Internet Marketing Journey

Internet marketing involves utilizing every available channel to achieve desired outcomes. This approach funded my college education and facilitated my transition from physics to marketing, essentially moving to what some might call the dark side.

互联网营销就是利用一切可用的渠道来达到预期目标。这种方法为我支付了大学学费，也让我从物理学转向了营销领域，可以说是转向了所谓的"黑暗面"。

## Key Factor for Growth

After numerous lectures and repeated discussions, what do you believe is the most critical element for growth? Please share your thoughts.

经过这么多节课和反复讨论，你们认为增长最关键的因素是什么？请分享一下想法。

### The Importance of Product and Retention

A great product is essential, as it attracts customers. However, merely having customers is insufficient; retention is paramount. Customers must not only stay engaged but also spread the word, making retention the single most important factor.

优秀的产品当然很重要，因为它能吸引客户。但仅仅有客户是不够的，留存才是最关键的。客户不仅要保持活跃，还要主动帮你宣传，这让留存成为最重要的因素。

# Growth Team Insights

At Facebook, we are fortunate to have an exceptional growth team, and I take great pride in being part of it. However, the fundamental advantage lies in our outstanding product. Working on growth at Facebook is a tremendous privilege because we are promoting a platform that people worldwide genuinely want to use. This creates an incredible opportunity: once users join and become familiar with Facebook, they tend to stay engaged.

在Facebook，我们很幸运拥有一支出色的增长团队，能成为其中一员让我非常骄傲。但根本优势在于我们的产品很棒。在Facebook做增长工作是一种巨大的特权，因为我们推广的是一个全世界的人都真心想要使用的平台。这创造了一个绝佳机会：一旦用户加入并熟悉Facebook，他们往往会保持活跃。

## Retention Curve Analysis

Through advising numerous startups—including notable collaborations with Airbnb and Coursera—I have consistently observed a critical pattern. When examining user engagement curves plotting activity levels against days since acquisition, the most telling indicator is the retention curve. The key to sustainable growth lies in achieving a retention curve that stabilizes at a sustainable plateau.

通过为许多初创公司提供咨询——包括与Airbnb和Coursera的重要合作——我一直观察到一个关键规律。在分析用户参与度曲线时，最能说明问题的指标就是留存曲线。实现可持续增长的关键在于让留存曲线稳定在一个可持续的水平上。

### Growth Trajectory Analysis

A viable business with product-market fit for a specific market segment typically exhibits growth parallel to the x-axis. However, most rapidly scaling companies—often discussed in terms of growth hacking and virality—demonstrate a different pattern. Their attention curve initially slopes downward toward the x-axis and eventually intercepts it.

一家在特定细分市场实现产品市场匹配的可行企业，通常其增长轨迹与x轴平行。但大多数快速扩张的公司——常以增长黑客和病毒式传播为话题——却显现出不同模式。它们的关注度曲线初期会向x轴倾斜下降，最终与x轴相交。

### Data-Driven Growth Methodology

When presenting this analysis, a common response is that Facebook’s growth team benefited from starting with a million daily users or 50 million total users, providing ample data for experimentation. However, we applied this same methodology to our B2B growth initiatives, such as self-service advertiser onboarding, to accurately forecast expansion potential.

在展示该分析时，常有人质疑Facebook增长团队因起步就拥有百万日活或五千万总用户而具备数据优势。但实际上，我们将相同方法论应用于B2B增长计划，例如自助式广告主入驻流程，通过分析精准预测增长空间。

# Market Analysis Methodology

When I joined Facebook, the product was only three days old. Within 90 days of its launch, we utilized analytical techniques to accurately project the one-year value of an advertiser. Our first-year prediction ultimately proved 97% accurate compared to the actual results. This demonstrates the critical importance of analyzing user engagement patterns.

我加入Facebook时，这个产品才发布三天。在发布后90天内，我们就用分析技术成功预测了广告商的年度价值。我们的首年预测结果与实际数据相比准确率达到97%。这充分说明了分析用户参与模式的极大重要性。

## User Engagement Analysis

The red line on this chart represents the number of users who have engaged with your product over a specific period. All users will have used the product for at least one day. However, if your product has been available for one year, there will naturally be zero users with 366 days of usage history. This logical progression forms the basis of understanding user retention patterns.

图表中的红线表示在特定时间段内使用过您产品的用户数量。所有用户至少会使用产品一天。但如果产品已上线一年，自然不会有用户达到366天的使用记录。这种逻辑递进关系是理解用户留存模式的基础。

# 用户留存率分析

Are these retention curves meaningful? Excellent. To analyze user engagement, begin by identifying all users who have been active on your product for exactly one day. Then determine what percentage of these users remain monthly active. Naturally, the rate will be 100% for the first 30 days since all users registered on the same day. However, starting from day 31, track the percentage of users who remain monthly active on each subsequent day—day 32, 33, 34, and so forth.

这些留存曲线有意义吗？很好。分析用户参与度时，首先筛选出使用产品刚满一天的所有用户，然后计算其中保持月活跃状态的用户比例。显然，前30天的比率会是100%，因为所有用户都在同一天注册。但从第31天开始，需要逐日跟踪保持月活跃状态的用户比例——包括第32天、33天、34天等。

This approach enables you to accurately project the engagement curve for your product with a sample size of just 10,000 customers. You'll be able to determine whether the curve eventually reaches an asymptote. While the data may become noisy towards the right-hand side of the graph—note that this is simulated data—you will still gain clear insight into whether the curve eventually flattens out.

这种方法只需约1万客户的样本量就能准确预测产品参与度曲线。您可以判断曲线最终是否会趋于平稳值。虽然图表右侧数据可能出现干扰（注：此为模拟数据），但仍能清晰判断曲线最终是否趋于平缓。

# Product-Market Fit Fundamentals

If your growth curve doesn't flatten out, avoid implementing growth tactics, pursuing virality, or hiring growth hackers. Instead, focus on achieving product-market fit. As Sam emphasized at the beginning of this course, success hinges on four key elements: idea, product, team, and execution. Without a strong product, effective growth execution becomes meaningless since sustainable growth cannot occur.

如果你的增长曲线未能趋于平缓，请避免实施增长策略、追求病毒式传播或聘请增长黑客。相反，应专注于实现产品与市场匹配。正如Sam在本课程开头强调的，成功取决于四个关键要素：创意、产品、团队和执行。若没有过硬的产品，有效的增长执行将失去意义，因为无法实现可持续增长。

## Identifying True Product-Market Fit

The most common issue I've observed both within Facebook's new products and among startups I've advised is that teams often believe they have achieved product-market fit when they actually haven't. This misconception represents the fundamental challenge in early-stage development.

我在Facebook的新产品部门以及指导过的初创公司中发现的最普遍问题是：团队经常误以为自己已经实现了产品与市场匹配，而实际情况并非如此。这种认知误区是早期发展阶段的核心挑战。

## Retention as a Key Metric

The most frequently asked follow-up question is: what constitutes good retention? While 5% retention might seem acceptable, successful platforms like Facebook historically achieved significantly higher rates. Simply having some retention is insufficient - the benchmark must be substantially higher to indicate true product-market fit.

人们最常追问的是：什么样的留存率才算合格？虽然5%的留存率看似可接受，但像Facebook这样成功的平台历来保持着远高于此的指标。仅拥有一定的留存率并不足够，必须达到显著更高的基准才能体现真正的产品与市场匹配。

# The Geoffrey Taylor Story

I find it frustrating when people ask me how to build a successful business, because the answer often lies in observable patterns. Let me share a meaningful anecdote: a 1950 Life magazine photograph capturing a Trinity nuclear bomb test features Geoffrey Taylor, a British physicist who later won the Nobel Prize. By analyzing the explosion’s dimensions in that image, Taylor calculated the precise power of the U.S. atomic bomb. Interestingly, the Russians published similar photos, applying dimensional analysis techniques.

当人们问我如何建立成功的企业时，我感到十分恼火，因为答案往往存在于可观察的规律中。我想分享一个有意义的故事：1950年《生活》杂志刊登了一张三位一体核试验的照片，图中涉及后来获得诺贝尔奖的英国物理学家杰弗里·泰勒。通过分析照片中爆炸的尺寸比例，他精确计算出美国原子弹的当量。值得注意的是，苏联也发布了类似照片，并运用了量纲分析技术。

# Dimensional Reasoning

Dimensional reasoning is one of the most valuable skills I acquired during my physics studies in the U.K. This approach involves analyzing the dimensions relevant to a problem. For example, when calculating energy, you work with units such as kilograms, meters squared, and seconds to the minus two. You then determine how to derive each of these units from the available data.

量纲分析是我在英国学习物理期间掌握的最有价值的技能之一。这种方法涉及分析与问题相关的量纲单位。例如，在计算能量时，需要处理千克、米的平方和秒的负二次方等单位。然后根据现有数据推导出每个单位的构成方式。

## Practical Application

By applying dimensional reasoning, one can solve complex problems with limited information. For instance, considering mass as the volume of a sphere introduces meters cubed. This approach enabled scientists to calculate the power of an atomic bomb, compare the power ratios between Russian and U.S. atomic weapons, and ultimately uncover one of the most highly classified secrets.

通过应用量纲分析，人们能够在有限信息下解决复杂问题。例如，将质量视为球体体积时会引入立方米单位。这种方法曾帮助科学家计算出原子弹的当量，比较苏美原子武器的威力比率，并最终揭开了最高机密之一。

# Internet User Statistics

At that time, determining the total number of internet users worldwide was relatively straightforward. While not exact, we could approximate the figure to be around 2 billion people. This estimation accounts for Facebook's absence in China, which has a population of approximately one billion.

当时，确定全球互联网用户总数相对简单。虽然并非精确数字，但我们可以估算出大约有20亿人。这个估算考虑了Facebook在中国无法使用的情况，而中国人口约10亿。

## Facebook User Analysis

According to Facebook's latest earnings report, the platform has approximately 1.3 billion active users. Although simply dividing this number by the total estimated internet users won't yield a perfectly accurate retention rate, it provides a reasonably close approximation for preliminary analysis.

根据Facebook最新财报显示，该平台拥有约13亿活跃用户。虽然简单地将这个数字除以预估的互联网用户总数无法得出完全准确的留存率，但能为初步分析提供足够接近的参考值。

# Facebook User Retention Analysis

Facebook's retention rate demonstrates strong user engagement. If the platform were to register every internet user, the retention rate would likely exceed current figures. Similarly, WhatsApp has announced 600 million active users. Considering global smartphone penetration rates, which are publicly available, one can extrapolate their potential user base.

中文翻译：
Facebook的用户留存率展现出强大的用户粘性。如果该平台注册了所有互联网用户，其留存率很可能超过当前数据。同样地，WhatsApp已宣布拥有6亿活跃用户。结合公开的全球智能手机普及率数据，可以推算出其潜在用户规模。

## E-commerce Retention Benchmarks

Amazon has attempted to enroll nearly the entire US population. Given known US internet user statistics and Amazon's published customer data, we can reasonably estimate their market penetration. Different industries require distinct terminal retention rates for business success. In e-commerce, maintaining monthly active user retention rates of 20-30% typically indicates sustainable operations.

中文翻译：
亚马逊曾尝试覆盖几乎全部美国人口。结合已知的美国互联网用户统计数据和亚马逊公布的客户数据，我们可以合理估算其市场渗透率。不同行业需要达到不同的最终留存率才能实现商业成功。在电子商务领域，保持20-30%的月活跃用户留存率通常意味着可持续运营。

# Retention Strategy for Social Media Platforms

If you are in the social media industry and your initial user cohort does not achieve at least 80% retention, it is unlikely that your platform will achieve massive scale. Retention rates vary significantly depending on your specific market vertical. It is essential to utilize analytical tools to identify comparable benchmarks and assess whether your performance aligns with successful standards in your industry.

如果你身处社交媒体行业，而首批用户的留存率未能达到至少80%，那么你的平台很难实现大规模增长。留存率的具体标准因所在细分市场而异。关键是要借助分析工具来确定可参照的行业基准，并评估自身表现是否符合该领域的成功标准。

Retention is the most critical factor for sustainable growth. It stems from having a compelling vision, a high-quality product that embodies that vision, and strong product-market fit. To evaluate retention effectiveness, we analyze whether installed users maintain long-term engagement when measured through cohort analysis. This methodology helps determine if the first 100, 1,000, or 10,000 users will continue using the product over time.

留存是可持续增长的核心要素。它源于具有吸引力的产品理念、支撑该理念的优质产品以及良好的市场契合度。我们通过群组分析法评估用户安装后的长期参与度，以此判断留存效果。这种方法能有效验证最初100名、1,000名乃至10,000名用户是否会形成持续使用习惯。

# Growth Strategy for Startups

In the long run, how should you approach operations to drive growth? Suppose you have achieved excellent product-market fit. For example, you have built an e-commerce site where 60% of customers return every month and make a purchase, which is absolutely fantastic. The question then becomes: how do you leverage this success and decide it's time to scale? Executing effectively should be the final consideration in your strategic planning.

从长远来看，应如何通过运营推动增长？假设你已实现出色的产品市场匹配度，例如创建了一个电商网站，每月有60%的客户复购，这无疑是极佳的表现。此时关键问题在于：如何借助这一优势判断扩张时机？有效执行应作为战略规划的最后环节。

## Rethinking Growth Teams

This is where growth teams become relevant. However, my contrarian perspective is that startups should not establish dedicated growth teams. The entire company should be focused on growth, rather than delegating it to a specialized unit.

这正是增长团队的价值所在。但我的反向观点是：初创企业不应设立独立增长团队。整个公司都应当聚焦增长，而非将其委派给特定部门。

# The Role of CEO in Growth Strategy

The CEO should ultimately serve as the head of the growth team. It is essential to have someone establish a clear North Star metric that defines the company's strategic direction. Based on my observations, this responsibility should fall to the leader of the organization. Mark Zuckerberg provides an excellent example of this principle in action. In Facebook's early days, while competitors like MySpace and Compact emphasized registered user counts, Mark championed monthly active users as the key metric—both internally and externally. He insisted that success meant not just attracting users to Facebook, but ensuring they remained actively engaged.

首席执行官应当成为增长团队的核心领导者。企业需要有人来设定明确的北极星指标，以指引公司的发展方向。根据我的观察，这一职责应由企业的最高负责人承担。马克·扎克伯格就是践行这一原则的典范。在Facebook早期发展阶段，当MySpace和Compact等竞争对手都在强调注册用户数量时，马克率先将月活跃用户数确立为关键指标——无论是内部考核还是对外宣传。他始终坚持：Facebook的成功不仅在于吸引用户注册，更在于保持用户的活跃度。

# Facebook's Key Metrics Strategy

Internally, Facebook used monthly active users as their core metric, which was also the number Mark Zuckerberg consistently presented to the public. This figure became the global benchmark by which the world measured Facebook's performance and the primary indicator the company prioritized.

Facebook内部采用月活跃用户数作为核心指标，这也是马克·扎克伯格对外持续公布的统一数据。该数字成为全球衡量Facebook表现的标准，也是公司最重视的关键指标。

## WhatsApp's Metric Selection

Jan Koum's approach with WhatsApp serves as an excellent example of metric selection. As a messaging application, WhatsApp consistently published sending statistics, recognizing that send volume is arguably the most crucial metric for such platforms.

WhatsApp创始人扬·库姆的指标选择策略堪称典范。作为即时通讯应用，WhatsApp始终公布消息发送量数据，因为这正是此类平台最核心的衡量标准。

### The Importance of Engagement Metrics

If users only open a messaging app once daily and send just one message, it indicates the platform hasn't become their primary communication tool. This explains why WhatsApp focused on publishing sending statistics rather than simple daily active user counts.

若用户每日仅打开通讯应用一次且只发送一条消息，说明该平台尚未成为其主要沟通工具。这解释了为何WhatsApp侧重公布发送量数据而非简单的日活跃用户数。

## Internal Metric Alignment

Within WhatsApp's internal operations, the team discussed meaningful metrics that truly reflected user engagement. These carefully selected metrics were subsequently incorporated into all public infographics and communications.

在WhatsApp内部运营中，团队会讨论能真实反映用户参与度的有效指标。这些精心筛选的指标随后被纳入所有对外发布的信息图表和公告中。

# Business Metrics Analysis

## Tech Company Benchmarks

Tech companies often establish unique key performance indicators. For instance, many travel platforms measure their success by comparing their booked nights against major hotel chains' performance. Each organization maintains distinct primary metrics that align with their specific industry verticals, rather than universally applying metrics like monthly active users.

科技公司通常设定独特的关键绩效指标。例如，许多旅游平台通过将其预订夜数与主要酒店连锁集团的业绩进行比较来衡量成功。每个组织都根据其特定行业领域保持不同的主要指标，而非统一采用月活跃用户等通用标准。

## eBay's Core Metric

During my tenure at eBay, the company's primary focus was gross merchandise volume - the total value of goods transacted through the platform. While external observers typically evaluate eBay based on revenue figures, this approach fails to capture the platform's true scale. As Benedict Evans' detailed analysis of Amazon demonstrates, distinguishing between marketplace and direct sales is crucial. eBay operates exclusively as a marketplace, meaning its actual transaction volume significantly exceeds its revenue, sometimes by a factor of ten or more.

在我任职eBay期间，公司的核心关注点是总商品交易额——即通过平台交易的商品总价值。虽然外部观察者通常基于收入数据评估eBay，但这种方法未能反映平台的真实规模。正如本尼迪克特·埃文斯对亚马逊的详细分析所示，区分平台业务与直销业务至关重要。eBay完全作为市场平台运营，这意味着其实际交易量远超收入，有时可达十倍以上。

## Internal Performance Assessment

This gross merchandise volume metric served as eBay's internal benchmark during my employment. The company prioritized this indicator over conventional revenue measurements to accurately gauge platform activity and business health.

总商品交易额这一指标在我任职期间是eBay的内部基准。公司优先考虑该指标而非传统收入计量，以准确衡量平台活动度和业务健康状况。

# Defining the North Star Metric

Every company requires a distinct north star metric when planning for growth. As a leader, it is critical to establish and clearly define this guiding metric when operating for expansion.

每家公司规划增长时都需要一个独特的北极星指标。作为领导者，在推动业务扩张时，确立并明确定义这一指导性指标至关重要。

The importance of this becomes evident once multiple people are working together. With over 100 people under my management, I have learned that direct control is impossible—everything operates through influence. While I can assign specific tasks to individuals, the majority will pursue what they believe to be most important.

当多人协同工作时，这一指标的重要性就变得尤为明显。在我管理超过100人的团队后，我认识到直接控制是不可能的——一切都要通过影响力来实现。虽然我可以给个别人分配具体任务，但大多数人会按照自己认为最重要的方向行动。

Without a clear north star, organizational alignment becomes challenging. At eBay, for instance, team members might naturally prioritize revenue, but that may not align with the company’s current strategic focus.

缺乏明确的北极星指标会导致组织难以协同。例如在eBay，团队成员可能自然而然地优先考虑收入，但这未必符合公司当前的战略重点。

# Strategic Focus at eBay

You know what we should focus on? It should be the number of people buying from us, or perhaps how many sellers list items on eBay. However, Pierre, Meg, John, and other leaders consistently emphasized that the true key metric is the gross merchandise volume processed through our platform. They maintained that the percentage of e-commerce flowing through our site is what truly matters for the company's success.

你知道我们应该关注什么吗？应该是从我们这里购买的客户数量，或者是在eBay上列出商品的卖家数量。然而，皮埃尔、梅格、约翰和其他领导层始终强调，真正的核心指标是我们平台处理的总商品交易额。他们坚持认为，通过我们网站实现的电子商务占比才是公司成功的关键。

This principle becomes crucial when product decisions are being made. When teams are discussing feature development away from meeting rooms, or when engineers are designing products at their computers, they must clearly understand that our priority isn't revenue generation. The fundamental focus should be on gross merchandise volume. Similarly, user registrations alone are insignificant unless they translate into long-term engagement.

这一原则在产品决策过程中至关重要。当团队在会议室之外讨论功能开发时，或当工程师在电脑前设计产品时，他们必须明确理解我们的首要目标不是营收。根本重点应该放在总商品交易额上。同样地，用户注册本身并不重要，除非能够转化为长期参与度。

# Affiliate Program Optimization

At eBay in 2004, we redesigned our affiliate compensation structure to better align with business objectives. Originally, we paid affiliates for driving confirmed registered users to our platform. While this approach engaged major marketers who operated independently, we recognized an opportunity to enhance quality. We transitioned to compensating only for activated confirmed registered users—requiring users not only to register but also to engage in core platform activities such as bidding, purchasing, or listing items.

在2004年，eBay重新设计了联盟会员补偿结构以更好地匹配业务目标。最初，我们向联盟会员支付费用是基于他们为平台带来的已确认注册用户数量。虽然这种方法吸引了独立运作的大型营销商参与，但我们发现了提升质量的机会。我们转而只对激活的已确认注册用户进行补偿——要求用户不仅完成注册，还要参与核心平台活动，如出价、购买或上架商品。

# Affiliate Strategy Impact on User Metrics

When we discontinued payments to affiliates, we experienced an immediate 20% decline in confirmed registered users driven by those partners. However, active confirmed installed users decreased by only 5%. This shift caused the ratio of confirmed installed users to active confirmed installed users to increase, subsequently accelerating the growth rate of active confirmed installed users.

当我们停止向联盟合作伙伴支付费用时，由这些渠道带来的确认注册用户数量立即下降了20%。然而，活跃确认安装用户仅减少了5%。这一转变使得确认安装用户与活跃确认安装用户的比例得以提升，进而显著加快了活跃确认安装用户的增长速度。

## User Journey Optimization Strategy

The underlying mechanism stems from different user acquisition approaches. To drive confirmed registrations, users searching for products like trampolines are directed to registration pages, creating the impression that signup is required before viewing items. In contrast, generating active confirmed registered users involves landing seekers directly on eBay's search results page, allowing them to discover desired products, develop purchase intent, and register naturally when ready to transact.

这种差异源于不同的用户获取策略。为提升注册量，搜索特定产品（如蹦床）的用户会被引导至注册页面，使其认为必须完成注册才能浏览商品。而要实现活跃确认注册用户增长，则需要将用户直接引导至eBay搜索结果页，让他们先发现心仪商品，激发购买意愿，最终在准备交易时自然完成注册。

## Critical Success Factor

The key insight is that focusing solely on confirmed registrations fails to create magical first experiences for new users. The most crucial consideration becomes how to orchestrate onboarding journeys that deliver transformative moments, making visitors immediately recognize the platform's value upon their first visit.

核心洞察在于：单纯追求注册量无法为新用户创造神奇的首体验。最重要的成功要素在于如何设计用户引导流程，打造具有转化意义的瞬间，让新用户在首次访问时就能直观感受到平台价值。

# Service Engagement Strategies

In the lecture notes for this course, I have included numerous links to individuals who demonstrate exceptional expertise in these subjects. Regarding the retention curve I presented earlier, there is a link to Danny Ferrante, who provides remarkable insights about retention curves.

在本课程的讲义中，我添加了许多相关领域杰出专家的链接。关于之前展示的用户留存曲线，附有丹尼·费兰特关于留存曲线的精彩讲解链接。

## Defining the Magic Moment

For the concept of the "magic moment", two relevant videos are provided. One features Chimoff discussing growth strategies - he established the growth team at Facebook. The other is a recording from four years ago at F8, where my friend Naomi and I explained our approach to growth at that time. Both presentations address the magic moment concept.

关于"神奇时刻"这一概念，我链接了两个相关视频：其一是奇莫夫关于增长策略的演讲——他创建了Facebook的增长团队；其二是我和好友娜奥米四年前在F8大会上的谈话记录，当时我们阐述了对于增长的理解。这两个视频都探讨了神奇时刻的概念。

### Case Study: Facebook's Onboarding Experience

What do you consider to be the magic moment when signing up for Facebook? After clicking the prominent green registration button, at what point do users experience that "aha" moment? Even Mark Zuckerberg addressed this concept during his startup phase.

你们认为注册Facebook时的神奇时刻是什么？当用户点击那个醒目的绿色注册按钮后，哪个瞬间会让他们产生"顿悟"的体验？早在创业初期，马克·扎克伯格就曾讨论过这个概念。

# The Importance of Social Connections

A few years back, we learned a fundamental lesson about social platforms: the core experience boils down to seeing your friends. It's as simple as that, and usually, it is very simple. I've spoken with numerous companies that attempt to overcomplicate their mission, but the essence remains straightforward. It's akin to the moment you see the first picture of a friend on Facebook and realize, "This is what the site is about."

几年前，我们在社交平台领域学到了一个基本经验：核心体验归根结底就是看到你的朋友。就这么简单，而且通常确实非常简单。我曾与许多公司交流，它们试图将自己的使命过度复杂化，但本质始终是直截了当的。这就像你在Facebook上看到朋友的第一张照片时恍然大悟："原来这个网站的意义就在这里。"

## The Critical Metric

Mark Zuckerberg discussed at Y Combinator the goal of helping users connect with ten friends within 14 days. This is precisely why we focus on that specific metric. The single most important element for any social media site is facilitating connections with your friends.

马克·扎克伯格在Y Combinator演讲时提到，要帮助用户在14天内结交十个朋友。这正是我们专注于该特定指标的原因。对于任何社交媒体网站而言，最重要的要素就是促进与朋友的连接。

### The Consequence of Isolation

Without establishing these connections, users are left with completely empty news feeds. Under such circumstances, they are clearly not going to return to the platform. They will never receive notifications, nor will friends inform them about things they might be missing.

若未能建立这些连接，用户面对的就是完全空白的动态信息流。在这种情况下，他们显然不会重返平台。他们永远不会收到通知，朋友也不会告知他们可能错过的事项。

# The Magic Moment in Digital Platforms

For Facebook, the magic moment occurs when you see your friend's face. Everything we do in growth is centered around this principle. If you examine the registration flows of LinkedIn, Twitter, or WhatsApp, the primary goal of these services is to promptly show you the people you wish to follow, connect with, or send messages to. In this vertical, that is what truly matters.

对于Facebook而言，神奇时刻就是当你看到朋友面孔的那个瞬间。我们在用户增长方面所做的一切都围绕这一原则展开。观察LinkedIn、Twitter或WhatsApp的注册流程，这些服务的首要目标都是尽快向你展示希望关注、联系或发送消息的对象。在这个垂直领域，这才是关键所在。

## Unique Value in Marketplace Platforms

When considering Airbnb or eBay, the magic moment differs. On eBay, it manifests as discovering that unique item—whether a PEZ糖果盒或损坏的激光笔—that you genuinely care about and wish to obtain. The moment you encounter that missing collectible constitutes the true magic moment for eBay. Similarly, on Airbnb, the magic moment arises when you find your first listing: an appealing property where you can imagine staying.

当考虑Airbnb或eBay时，神奇时刻的表现形式有所不同。在eBay上，它体现为发现你真正关心并希望获得的独特物品——无论是PEZ糖果盒还是损坏的激光笔。当你遇到梦寐以求的收藏品时，这便是eBay真正的神奇时刻。同样在Airbnb上，神奇时刻出现在你发现首个房源时：一个能让你想象入住的迷人住所。

# The Magic Moment Concept

A magic moment occurs when a user first experiences the core value of a product. For example, when listing a house or an item on eBay, receiving the first payment creates an amazing moment. Similarly, on platforms like Airbnb, the initial positive user experience represents such a pivotal point.

魔法时刻是指用户首次体验到产品核心价值的瞬间。例如在挂牌出租房屋或在eBay上架商品时，收到第一笔付款就会创造这种奇妙时刻。同样在Airbnb等平台，用户最初的积极体验也代表着这样的关键节点。

## Identifying Key Moments

You should consult Brian's insights, as his team has developed remarkable storyboards illustrating user journeys through these magic moments. His expertise in helping users feel love and joy through product experiences is exceptional - he'll be delivering three lectures on this topic soon.

建议参考Brian的见解，他的团队制作了精彩的故事板来展示用户经历魔法时刻的旅程。他擅长通过产品体验让用户感受到爱与喜悦，这方面能力出众——他即将就此主题进行三场讲座。

## Strategic Implementation

Identify the magic moment for your product and facilitate user connection to it as rapidly as possible. This approach enables moving beyond the asymptotic blue line of retention rates, allowing smooth progression from 50% to 60% and eventually 70% retention when users discover what truly engages them.

明确产品的魔法时刻并尽快让用户与之建立连接。这种方法能帮助突破留存率的渐近瓶颈，当用户发现真正吸引他们的价值时，留存率就能从50%顺利提升至60%乃至70%。

## Growth Optimization Strategy

Many companies in Silicon Valley make the same mistake when optimizing for growth by focusing solely on their own experiences. A prime example is notification systems. When discussing notifications, nearly every company concludes they receive too many and should reduce them. However, this approach overlooks a critical question: Are your most engaged users abandoning your platform due to excessive notifications? If not, optimizing for this issue is unnecessary—power users are typically capable of managing notifications through filters. The real focus should be on marginal users who receive no notifications over extended periods, whether daily, monthly, or yearly. Ultimately, creating an exceptional product requires prioritizing the experience of these underrepresented users.

许多硅谷公司在优化增长策略时都会犯同样的错误——仅基于自身体验做决策。以通知系统为例，几乎所有公司在讨论时都认为推送过多，应当削减数量。但这种思路忽略了一个关键问题：您的核心用户是否因通知过多而流失？如果答案是否定的，那么优化方向就出现了偏差——资深用户通常能够自主管理通知设置。真正的重点应放在边缘用户身上，即那些在特定周期（每日、每月甚至每年）内未收到任何通知的用户。归根结底，打造卓越产品的核心在于关注这些弱势群体的使用体验。

# Growth Strategy Insights

For power users, building an exceptional product indeed involves optimizing for those who use it most frequently. However, when driving growth, the primary focus should not be on existing heavy users. As highlighted in Danny Ferrante's video and the linked lecture materials, we employ a growth accounting framework to analyze user dynamics.

为高级用户打造卓越产品确实需要为最频繁使用者进行优化。然而在推动增长时，重点不应放在现有重度用户身上。正如Danny Ferrante视频及相关讲座资料所指出的，我们采用增长核算框架来分析用户动态。

## User Segmentation Analysis

Our framework examines three key segments: new users, resurrected users (those returning after 30+ days inactive), and churned users. Across virtually every product I've studied, the combined metrics of resurrected and churned users consistently outweigh new user acquisition figures, particularly after reaching sustainable growth maturity over multiple years.

我们的分析框架涵盖三个关键群体：新用户、回流用户（间隔30天以上重新活跃）和流失用户。在我研究过的几乎所有产品中，回流用户与流失用户的综合数据始终超过新用户获取量，特别是在产品经过多年发展进入稳定增长阶段后。

## Critical User Behavior Pattern

Notably, both churned and resurrected user groups typically exhibited low friend connection counts, indicating this as a significant factor influencing user retention and re-engagement.

值得注意的是，流失用户和回流用户群体通常都表现出好友连接数偏低的特点，这表明这是影响用户留存和重新激活的重要因素。

# Growth Strategy Insights

Many users initially struggled to find friends on Facebook, which prevented them from connecting with meaningful content and interactions. Our primary focus became helping them reach a critical threshold—whether ten friends or another key number—to fully engage with the platform.

许多用户最初在Facebook上难以找到朋友，导致他们无法接触到有意义的内容和互动。我们的首要任务是帮助他们达到关键阈值——无论是十个朋友还是其他关键数量——从而充分融入平台。

## Defining the North Star Metric

When operating for growth, it is essential to identify your company’s "north star" metric. This single metric should align the entire organization: if every employee prioritizes it and directs product decisions and actions toward increasing it, long-term success becomes achievable. Importantly, since key metrics are often interrelated, selecting almost any core metric can effectively drive progress.

在追求增长时，确定公司的“北极星”指标至关重要。这一核心指标应统一整个组织的方向：如果每位员工都优先关注该指标，并将产品决策和行动导向其提升，长期成功便可实现。值得注意的是，由于关键指标通常相互关联，选择几乎任何核心指标都能有效推动进展。

# Metric Selection Strategy

When selecting key metrics, prioritize the option that resonates most deeply with your mission and values. Realistically, metrics like daily active users often correlate strongly with monthly active users – either could have served as valid choices. Similarly, the amount of content shared inherently correlates with user growth, as new users naturally generate content.

Choose a metric that aligns with your long-term vision while establishing a clear north star. Identify the magic moment when users experience core value, ensuring this moment drives your primary metric. Focus on marginal users rather than personal preferences, as these principles form the foundation of effective metric selection.

指标选择策略

选择关键指标时，应优先考虑与企业使命和价值观最契合的选项。实际上，日活跃用户与月活跃用户通常存在强关联性——两者皆可作为有效选择。同样地，内容分享量也天然与用户增长相关，因为新增用户自然会创造内容。

选择的指标需符合长期愿景，同时确立明确的北极星指标。要识别用户体验核心价值的关键时刻，确保这一时刻能驱动主要指标。重点关注边际用户而非个人偏好，这些原则构成了有效指标选择的基础。

# Growth Strategy Framework

You're operating for growth, but everything has to come from the top. The final area to address is tactics. I intended to cover several key tactics from my prepared list, though I typically explain these better using a whiteboard. Feel free to ask questions as we proceed regarding their implementation and optimization.

你在为增长而运营，但一切必须自上而下推动。最后要讨论的领域是战术。我原计划讲解清单中的若干关键战术，尽管我通常借助白板能更清晰地阐述这些内容。讲解过程中欢迎大家随时提问，以便深入探讨具体操作和优化方法。

## Implementing Effective Tactics

The crucial tactics require careful consideration. Tom Fishburne – an excellent fellow based in the Bay Area – creates brilliantly cynical cartoons that I greatly admire. Suppose you've identified your niche market where you can establish a monopoly within the mousetrap industry. Imagine a silenced mousetrap designed for placement under beds, eliminating mice overnight without disturbing sleep. This represents your specialized market segment where your mousetrap outperforms all competitors.

关键战术需要仔细规划。以汤姆·菲什伯恩——一位居住在海湾地区的杰出人士——创作的讽刺漫画为例，这些作品令我十分赞赏。假设你已在捕鼠器市场确定了能够建立垄断地位的利基市场。比如专为床底设计的静音捕鼠器，可在夜间消灭老鼠而不惊扰睡眠。这便构成了你的专业市场领域，在此领域你的产品性能超越所有竞争者。

# Marketing Misconceptions in Silicon Valley

In Silicon Valley, there is a common perception that marketers are useless. As a former physics student, I once shared this view, and I suspect many engineering students similarly consider marketers unnecessary – believing that simply building a product will naturally attract users. This "build it and they will come" mentality is deeply ingrained in the Valley's culture, but I disagree with this approach. I believe sustained effort is essential. A relevant article linked on the lecture page, featuring an interview with Ben Silvermann, discusses how marketing drove Pinterest's growth. It is a highly recommended read, though I acknowledge my bias as a marketer.

在硅谷，普遍存在一种观念认为营销人员毫无用处。我曾是物理专业的学生，也曾持相同看法，并且我猜许多工程专业的学生同样认为营销人员无关紧要——他们相信只要产品做得好，用户自然会来。这种"酒香不怕巷子深"的心态在硅谷文化中根深蒂固，但我并不认同这种观点。我认为持续的努力至关重要。讲座页面链接的一篇相关文章收录了对本·西尔弗曼的访谈，其中讨论了营销如何推动Pinterest的增长。这是一篇非常值得深入阅读的文章，不过作为营销从业者，我承认自己存在立场偏见。

## Initial Growth Tactics: Internationalization

The first growth strategy I will address is internationalization. Facebook's global expansion serves as a prime example of this approach.

我要讨论的第一个增长策略是国际化。Facebook的全球扩张就是这种策略的典型范例。

# International Expansion Challenges

It was too late when Sheryl stated this publicly, and I completely agree. One of the biggest barriers to our long-term growth was dealing with cloned platforms in various countries. Notably, Studivelt had implemented Fakebook.css in their HTML code. There were numerous similar sites globally—whether obvious clones like Studivelt, or regional platforms such as Vkontakte, Mixi, Cyworld, and Orkut. These social networks emerged worldwide while Facebook remained focused on the U.S. market. Therefore, internationalization became a critical barrier we needed to overcome, as breaking down barriers is essential for sustainable growth.

当谢丽尔公开提出这一点时已经太迟了，我完全赞同这个观点。我们长期增长的最大障碍之一是需要应对各国出现的克隆平台。值得注意的是，Studivelt甚至在其HTML代码中使用了Fakebook.css。当时全球存在大量类似网站——无论是明显的克隆平台如Studivelt，还是区域性社交网络如Vkontakte、Mixi、Cyworld和Orkut。在Facebook专注于美国市场期间，这些社交网络已在全球范围内兴起。因此，国际化成为我们必须突破的关键障碍，因为打破壁垒对持续增长至关重要。

## Growth Through Barrier Removal

Facebook initially launched as a college-exclusive platform. Each new college we expanded to represented breaking down a barrier. When Facebook later extended beyond colleges to high schools—though I had left the company by then—it created a pivotal moment that shook the organization. Many questioned whether Facebook could maintain its core culture and survive this expansion.

Facebook最初仅面向大学校园开放。每进入一所新大学都意味着突破一个壁垒。当Facebook后来从大学扩展到高中时——虽然我当时已离开公司——这一转变成为了震撼公司的关键时刻。许多人质疑Facebook能否在扩张过程中保持其核心文化并持续生存。

# Growth Challenges at Facebook

We initially expanded from high schools to the general public just before I joined the company. That shift was a shocking moment that spurred our growth to 50 million users. However, we soon hit a brick wall. At that point, serious existential questions arose within Facebook about whether any social network could ever surpass 100 million users. While this concern sounds unreasonable now, no company had achieved it at the time. Every platform seemed to plateau between 50 to 100 million users, and we worried it might be impossible to break through.

我们最初在我加入公司之前从高中扩展到公众领域。这一转变是一个令人震惊的时刻，推动我们增长到5000万用户。然而，我们很快遇到了瓶颈。当时，Facebook内部开始出现关于社交网络是否能够突破1亿用户大关的生存性质疑。虽然现在这个担忧听起来很不合理，但当时确实没有公司实现过这个目标。所有平台似乎都在5000万到1亿用户之间停滞不前，我们担心这可能是个无法突破的壁垒。

## Formation of the Growth Team

It was at this critical juncture that the growth team was established. Chamath Palihapitiya brought a group of us together to address this challenge. He has publicly stated multiple times that he considered firing me, and perhaps he should have. But without Chamath's leadership, I believe none of us would have succeeded in overcoming those growth barriers.

正是在这个关键时刻，增长团队应运而生。查马斯·帕里哈皮提亚将我们聚集在一起应对这个挑战。他曾多次公开表示考虑过解雇我，也许他当初应该这么做。但如果没有查马斯的领导，我相信我们没有人能够成功突破那些增长障碍。

# Early Growth Strategies

We were a rather unconventional group of people at the company, yet we managed to make it work effectively. Initially, two key strategies significantly drove our growth. First, we concentrated on the "ten friends in 14 days" initiative, guiding users to reach that crucial magic moment of engagement. This approach was strongly championed by Zuckerberg, as the team had been trapped in analysis paralysis, debating whether user activity correlated with or was caused by having friends. He decisively cut through the hesitation by questioning how anyone could expect users to remain active on Facebook without friends.

我们是一群相当特立独行的人，但最终成功让公司运转良好。初期有两个关键策略极大地推动了增长。首先，我们专注于"14天内添加10个好友"计划，引导用户达到那个关键的参与魔法时刻。这个方法得到扎克伯格的强力支持，因为团队当时陷入了分析瘫痪状态，争论用户活跃度究竟是与好友数量相关还是因果相连。他果断打破僵局，反问如果用户没有好友，怎么可能期待他们在Facebook保持活跃？

## International Expansion Execution

The second major driver was internationalization, which eliminated yet another barrier to growth. When we launched this initiative, two aspects were executed particularly well. Despite being behind schedule and feeling pressured by the delay, we dedicated sufficient time to build a solid foundation for the international expansion.

第二个关键增长动力是国际化，这消除了另一个增长障碍。在推进这项计划时，有两个方面执行得尤为出色。尽管进度落后且面临时间压力，我们仍然投入足够时间为国际化扩展奠定了坚实基础。

# Scaling Through Strategic Development

We adopted a deliberate approach to build scalable solutions. By moving slowly initially, we ultimately accelerated our progress. For a comprehensive account, you may view Naomi's detailed presentation among the video resources linked on the lecture page.

我们通过审慎的方法构建可扩展的解决方案。初期缓慢推进的策略最终加速了整体进展。如需了解完整细节，您可在课程页面的相关视频链接中观看Naomi的详细讲解。

Our methodology involved encapsulating all website strings using FPT through our translation extraction script. This facilitated the creation of a community-driven translation platform, enabling collective user participation beyond professional translators. This approach yielded remarkable efficiency - French translation was completed within 12 hours.

我们的实施方案通过翻译提取脚本采用FPT技术封装了所有网站字符串，由此建立了社区驱动的翻译平台，使普通用户也能参与翻译工作。这种方法成效显著——法语翻译在12小时内即告完成。

To date, Facebook's platform supports 104 languages, with over 70 of these localized through community contributions. We invested in developing infrastructure that ensures sustainable scalability. Another critical success factor was our strategic language prioritization, initially focusing on major languages including French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Chinese.

目前Facebook平台已支持104种语言，其中超过70种由社区完成本地化。我们投入建设的基础设施确保了可持续的扩展能力。另一个关键成功因素在于合理的语言优先级规划，初期重点聚焦法语、意大利语、德语、西班牙语及中文等主要语言。

# Global Language Strategy Evolution

Initially, our access was restricted in China, prompting a strategic shift toward European markets including French, Italian, German, and Spanish. Examining the current linguistic landscape reveals significant changes: Italian has disappeared from key language lists, while French and German are nearing obsolescence. Conversely, our Hindi user base on Facebook quadrupled within the past year alone.

我们最初在中国受阻，因此将战略重心转向包括法语、意大利语、德语和西班牙语在内的欧洲市场。观察当前语言分布格局可见显著变化：意大利语已从关键语言列表中消失，而法语和德语也濒临淘汰。相反地，过去一年间我们在Facebook上的印地语用户数量翻了两番。

## Future-Oriented Infrastructure Development

Many social networks mistakenly designed their systems based on current linguistic distributions. We avoided this pitfall by creating scalable translation infrastructure capable of accommodating all languages, thereby positioning ourselves for future global language trends.

许多社交网络错误地依据当前语言分布来设计系统。我们通过建立可扩展的翻译基础设施规避了这一陷阱，该架构能够兼容所有语言，从而为未来的全球语言趋势做好充分准备。

### Upcoming Language Initiatives

Further developments regarding our language translation roadmap will be unveiled during today's Internet.org Summit in India. The summit proceedings are expected to detail our forthcoming multilingual expansion strategies.

关于语言翻译路线图的进一步进展将在今日于印度举行的Internet.org峰会上公布。预计会议议程将详细说明我们即将实施的多语言扩展战略。

# Virality Strategies

I encourage everyone to ask questions as we go through these concepts. This should be a more free-form discussion anyway. Some of these viral tactics are quite interesting.

我鼓励大家在讨论这些概念时随时提问。这应该是一个更自由形式的讨论。其中一些病毒式传播策略非常有趣。

There are two primary approaches to virality. I highly recommend Adam Penenberg's book "Viral Loop" (shown on the right), which provides numerous case studies of companies that achieved growth through viral marketing. For those interested in this topic, it's an excellent resource.

病毒式传播主要有两种方法。我强烈推荐亚当·彭宁伯格的《病毒循环》（右侧所示），该书通过大量案例研究展示了企业如何通过病毒营销实现增长。对此话题感兴趣的人来说，这是极佳的学习资料。

Ogilvy on Advertising is another outstanding reference. Chapter seven illustrates creative thinking - for instance, attaching a car to a billboard with super glue to demonstrate product strength. The book contains many such effective marketing examples.

《奥格威谈广告》是另一本优秀参考书。第七章展示了创造性思维——例如用超级胶水将汽车固定在广告牌上来展示产品强度。书中包含许多此类有效的营销案例。

# Virality Framework

Every new member on my team receives these two books, which contain creative tips from thought leaders. For instance, one author passed away twenty years ago, yet his insights remain so relevant that I continue to share his works with new team members.

我的每位新团队成员都会收到这两本书，其中包含来自思想领袖的创意建议。例如，有位作者虽已去世二十年，但他的见解至今仍具现实意义，因此我持续将他的著作分享给新成员。

## Sean Park's Virality Model

Sean Park introduced a virality model during my onboarding at Facebook, framing product virality through three key elements. The first is payload, referring to the number of people reached per viral event. The second is frequency, indicating how often those people can be engaged. The third is conversion rate, measuring the effectiveness of each interaction. Though Sean used more polished terminology, the core concepts remain payload, frequency, and conversion rate—regardless of their order.

肖恩·帕克在我加入Facebook时介绍了一个病毒式传播模型，通过三个关键要素来构建产品的病毒性。第一是载荷量，指每次病毒事件触达的人数；第二是频率，表示能够触达这些人的频次；第三是转化率，衡量每次互动的有效性。尽管肖恩使用了更精炼的术语，核心概念始终是载荷量、频率和转化率——无论其排列顺序如何。

### Core Metrics Explained

Payload determines the scale of each outreach effort, frequency defines how repeatedly audiences can be exposed, and conversion rate reflects the probability of desired user actions. Together, these metrics provide a foundational understanding of a product's potential viral growth.

载荷量决定了每次推广的覆盖规模，频率定义了受众能被触达的重复次数，而转化率反映了用户采取预期行动的概率。这些指标共同构成了评估产品病毒式增长潜力的基础框架。

# Hotmail's Viral Marketing Strategy

Hotmail serves as the canonical example of brilliant viral marketing. When Hotmail launched, numerous email companies had received funding and were investing heavily in traditional advertising. At that time, individuals could not access free email clients independent of their ISP. Hotmail and a few other companies introduced web-based email services accessible from any location—whether through library, school, or public internet connections. This represented a significant value proposition for users seeking portable email access.

Hotmail是病毒式营销的典范案例。在Hotmail推出时，许多获得投资的邮件公司正大量投入传统广告。当时用户无法使用独立于网络服务商的免费邮件客户端。Hotmail等企业推出的网页邮件服务实现了随地访问——无论是通过图书馆、学校还是公共网络连接。这对需要便携邮件服务的用户构成了重要价值主张。

# Marketing Strategy Comparison

Most companies launched extensive advertising campaigns through television, billboards, and newspapers to promote Yahoo. However, the Hotmail team operated with limited funding, forcing them to devise alternative strategies. Their solution was to embed a small link at the bottom of every email stating: "Sent from Hotmail, get your free email here."

大多数公司通过电视、广告牌和报纸开展大规模广告活动来推广雅虎。然而，Hotmail团队资金有限，迫使他们制定替代策略。他们的解决方案是在每封邮件底部嵌入一个小链接，注明："来自Hotmail，此处获取免费邮箱"。

## Viral Mechanism Analysis

Although each email's promotional impact was minimal since messages were typically sent to individual recipients, the strategy achieved high frequency exposure. Users repeatedly emailed the same contacts, causing the Hotmail link to appear before recipients multiple times daily. This repetitive exposure effectively reinforced brand awareness.

虽然每封邮件的推广效果有限（因为邮件通常发送给单个收件人），但该策略实现了高频次曝光。用户反复向相同联系人发送邮件，使Hotmail链接每日多次出现在收件人面前。这种重复性曝光有效强化了品牌认知。

# Viral Growth Mechanisms

Hotmail achieved remarkable viral growth due to its high frequency of use and exceptional conversion rates. Users were motivated to switch from ISP-bound email services, leading to rapid adoption.

中文翻译：
Hotmail因其高使用频率和出色的转化率实现了显著的病毒式增长。用户倾向于摆脱运营商邮箱的束缚，这推动了该服务的快速普及。

## PayPal's Dual-Sided Strategy

PayPal's viral growth was uniquely driven by its dual-sided platform connecting buyers and sellers. While its core payment functionality had low frequency and modest viral payload, the service creatively incentivized referrals by offering cash rewards for inviting friends. This strategy compensated for natural viral limitations.

中文翻译：
PayPal的病毒式增长由其连接买卖双方的双边平台独特驱动。尽管核心支付功能使用频率较低且病毒传播力有限，该服务通过现金奖励邀请机制创新地弥补了天然传播缺陷。

# Virality Mechanisms

PayPal achieved virality through distinct approaches for consumers and sellers. On the consumer side, they incentivized sign-ups by offering $10, which naturally encouraged sharing. For sellers, no such incentive was necessary because the promise of receiving payments was sufficient motivation. In both cases, their exceptional conversion rates were driven by high-value transactions and frequent usage patterns.

PayPal通过不同的方式在消费者和卖家之间实现病毒式传播。在消费者端，他们通过提供10美元注册奖励自然激励了用户分享。对于卖家而言，由于收款功能的天然吸引力，无需额外激励。两者的高转化率都得益于高频次的高价值交易场景。

## Contrasting Viral Models

Unlike platforms relying on email sharing, Facebook's virality emerged organically through word-of-mouth. The unique aspect of PayPal and Hotmail was that initial usage required sending an email to another person, creating inherent network effects.

与依赖邮件分享的平台不同，Facebook的病毒式传播主要通过口碑实现自然增长。PayPal和Hotmail的独特之处在于，首次使用必须向他人发送邮件，这种设计天然形成了网络效应。

# Viral Growth Mechanisms

Facebook's growth was not driven by viral marketing in the traditional sense. Unlike services with built-in contact features, Facebook had no native way to reach people outside its platform. Its expansion relied primarily on word-of-mouth virality because the product itself was compelling enough that users actively recommended it to friends.

Facebook的增长并非传统意义上的病毒式营销所致。与内置联系人功能的服务不同，Facebook没有原生方式触达平台外的用户。其扩张主要依靠口碑传播，因为产品本身具有足够吸引力，促使用户主动向朋友推荐。

## Scaling Dynamics of Viral Campaigns

Regarding the question about viral campaign payloads: during initial stages, the invitation volume remains low as only early adopters participate. However, as the campaign gains momentum across multiple cycles, the payload escalates exponentially. Each participant begins inviting larger networks, creating compound growth where every new user generates disproportionately more invitations.

关于病毒活动负载的问题：在初始阶段，由于只有早期采用者参与，邀请量保持低位。但随着活动在多轮周期中形成势头，负载将呈指数级增长。每位参与者开始邀请更庞大的社交网络，形成复合增长效应——每个新用户都会产生不成比例的更多邀请。

# Email Scaling Considerations

Initially, I assumed emails were only sent to small groups. Compared to modern viral engines that import entire contact books or broadcast to all Facebook friends, the actual reach of early email systems remained quite limited. Even frequent emailers typically contacted relatively small circles.

中文翻译：
最初，我假设电子邮件只发送给小型群体。与如今导入整个通讯录或向所有Facebook好友广播的病毒式传播引擎相比，早期电子邮件系统的实际覆盖范围仍然相当有限。即使是频繁发送邮件的人，通常也只会联系相对较小的圈子。

## Recipient Volume Analysis

My focus was on the recipient count per individual email. However, the valid observation is that as Hotmail's user base expands and email adoption increases, the cumulative volume of sent messages grows exponentially. This network effect ultimately drives the product's successful scaling.

中文翻译：
我原本关注的是每封邮件的收件人数量。但值得注意的合理观点是：随着Hotmail用户群扩大和电子邮件普及度提升，发送邮件的累计数量将呈指数级增长。这种网络效应最终推动产品实现规模化成功。

### Conversion Factors

> > Does the conversion point also matter? For instance, when users simply click...

中文翻译：

> > 转化节点是否同样重要？例如当用户仅仅点击...

# Conversion Optimization Strategies

While clicking to sign up on digital platforms like Hotmail provides immediate conversion, offline advertisements require users to manually recall URLs, navigate websites, and locate registration buttons. Reducing friction throughout this process is critical. Transitioning from offline to online advertising significantly streamlines the user journey by eliminating multiple steps.

虽然像Hotmail这样的数字平台可以通过点击立即完成注册，但线下广告需要用户手动回忆网址、浏览网站并找到注册按钮。减少整个过程中的摩擦至关重要。从线下广告转向线上广告能通过消除多个步骤显著简化用户旅程。

## The Relationship Between Frequency and Conversion

Frequency and conversion rates are fundamentally interconnected. Repeatedly exposing users to identical promotions or emails creates familiarity, which can positively influence conversion likelihood. This correlation underscores the importance of strategic repetition in marketing campaigns.

频率和转化率本质上是相互关联的。反复向用户展示相同的促销内容或邮件能建立熟悉度，从而对转化可能性产生积极影响。这种关联性凸显了营销活动中策略性重复的重要性。

# Creative Fatigue in Digital Marketing

Repeated exposure to the same banner ads highlights a fundamental principle of online marketing. These rules apply uniformly across all channels. When users are targeted with identical Facebook ads repeatedly, click-through rates decline with each exposure. This phenomenon is known as creative fatigue, necessitating regular rotation of advertising creatives on Facebook.

重复展示相同的横幅广告揭示了网络营销的一个基本原则。这些规则在所有渠道中普遍适用。当用户被重复推送相同的Facebook广告时，每次曝光后的点击率都会下降。这种现象被称为创意疲劳，需要在Facebook上定期轮换广告创意。

## Cross-Platform Consistency

The same pattern applies to banner advertisements and news feed stories. Upon encountering the same news feed story for the fiftieth time, users are unlikely to click if they have ignored the previous forty-nine exposures. This behavioral principle holds equally true for email marketing campaigns.

这种模式同样适用于横幅广告和信息流故事。当用户第五十次看到相同的信息流故事时，如果前四十九次都未点击，这次也不会例外。这一行为准则在邮件营销活动中同样适用。

### Email Marketing Implications

Sending identical invitation emails repeatedly, or persistently including the same hyperlink in email signatures, will yield diminishing returns. The effectiveness of such communications decreases with each repetition, mirroring the creative fatigue observed in other digital marketing channels.

重复发送相同的邀请邮件，或在邮件签名中持续使用相同的超链接，会产生收益递减效应。这类通信的有效性会随着重复次数的增加而降低，这与在其他数字营销渠道中观察到的创意疲劳现象一致。

# Viral Marketing Strategies

When comparing Hotmail to PayPal, the key difference lies in user acquisition. PayPal achieved growth primarily through voluntary sign-ups, whereas other services may employ different approaches. It is well established that higher frequency of identical marketing messages correlates with lower conversion rates. This fundamental principle applies universally across all digital marketing channels.

在比较Hotmail和PayPal时，关键差异在于用户获取方式。PayPal主要通过自愿注册实现增长，而其他服务可能采用不同策略。业已证实，重复推送相同营销信息的频率越高，转化率就越低。这一基本原则适用于所有数字营销渠道。

## Uber's Growth Framework

A notable approach to virality was developed by Ed, who currently leads Uber's growth team after previously serving on Facebook's growth team. As a Stanford MBA student, Ed participated in a similar course discussing viral mechanisms, where participants subsequently developed successful viral products that received significant media attention for their innovative designs.

Uber的增长团队展现出非凡的专注度，其病毒式增长框架值得关注。该框架由现任Uber增长负责人Ed创立，他曾在Facebook增长团队任职。在斯坦福MBA课程期间，Ed参与过类似病毒传播机制的研讨，学员后来开发的病毒式产品因其创新设计获得了广泛媒体报道。

### Core Growth Principles

The most compelling aspect of Uber's growth strategy is their intense focus on scalable user acquisition methods. Their team consistently demonstrates how disciplined execution of fundamental growth principles can drive remarkable market expansion.

Uber增长策略最引人注目的在于其对可扩展用户获取方法的高度专注。该团队持续证明，对基本增长原则的严格执行能够推动显著的市场扩张。

# Driver Acquisition Strategy

Operating a two-sided marketplace necessitates a strong focus on driver acquisition. This remains a major priority for the team, even though the company employs some of the world's leading experts in viral growth.

## Viral Growth Funnel

The viral growth process begins when a user imports their contacts. Key metrics include the percentage of users who proceed to send invitations, the number of contacts each invitation reaches, and the resulting click-through rate. Additional steps can be incorporated, such as tracking email opens and clicks. Ultimately, the goal is to maximize the number of users who sign up and import their contacts, successfully send invitations to all those contacts, and ensure those invitations reach every intended recipient.

病毒增长流程始于用户导入其联系人。关键指标包括继续发送邀请的用户比例、每份邀请覆盖的联系人数量以及产生的点击率。可以加入更多环节进行追踪，例如邮件打开率和点击率。最终目标是最大化完成注册并导入联系人的用户数量，确保他们向所有联系人成功发送邀请，并使每份邀请都送达目标收件人。

# Viral Growth Metrics

To calculate viral growth, you need to consider multiple conversion stages. First, determine the percentage of recipients who click on an invitation, followed by the percentage who complete sign-up. Multiplying these conversion rates at each stage reveals the viral coefficient (K-factor).

For example, if each user sends invitations to 100 people, with 10% clicking and 50% signing up, you reach 10 conversions. If only 10-20% of new users subsequently import contacts, the K-factor falls to 0.5-1.0. At this range, sustainable viral growth becomes challenging.

病毒增长指标

计算病毒式增长需考虑多个转化阶段。首先确定点击邀请的接收者比例，接着计算完成注册的比例。将各阶段转化率相乘即可得出病毒系数（K因子）。

例如，若每个用户向100人发送邀请，其中10%点击链接且50%完成注册，可获得10个转化用户。如果新用户中仅10-20%会后续导入联系人，病毒系数将降至0.5-1.0。在此范围内，难以实现可持续的病毒式增长。

# Viral Growth Analysis

Platforms like Vidi excel at generating viral content, consistently achieving a k-factor above one. While attaining a high k-factor is feasible, it becomes irrelevant if user retention remains low. Therefore, focus should shift from virality to sustainable engagement.

像Vidi这样的平台擅长制造病毒式传播内容，能够持续实现k因子大于1的效果。虽然获得高k因子是可行的，但如果用户留存率持续低迷，这种传播效果就失去了意义。因此重点应从病毒式传播转向可持续的用户参与度。

## Key Metrics Evaluation

To assess viral potential, analyze your invitation funnel by examining: how many recipients each inviter reaches, the click-through rate of invitations, conversion rates to your platform, and subsequent import actions. These metrics collectively reveal your actual k-factor.

评估病毒传播潜力时，需通过以下维度分析邀请漏斗：每位邀请人覆盖的接收者数量、邀请链接的点击率、转化为平台用户的比率以及后续的导入行为。这些指标共同反映出真实的k因子水平。

## Strategic Prioritization

The critical insight remains prioritizing retention over virality. Only after establishing substantial retained user volume per inviter should viral mechanisms be activated. Sustainable growth hinges on solid retention foundations before amplifying reach.

核心策略始终是将用户留存置于病毒传播之上。只有在每位邀请人能带来可观留存用户的基础上，才能启动病毒式增长机制。可持续的增长模式依赖于在扩大影响范围前先夯实留存基础。

# Digital Marketing Strategies

## Search Engine Optimization Considerations

Effective SEO begins with comprehensive keyword research. Many marketers approach this critical step incorrectly. For instance, when launching a cocktail website, I spent a full year optimizing content to rank for the term "cocktail making." While I successfully dominated this search term in the UK market, the strategy proved ineffective as only about 500 people monthly search for that phrase. Consequently, the website attracted merely 400 visitors per month. The optimal approach would have been targeting "cocktail recipes" for the UK market and "drink recipes" for the larger US market, which represent significantly higher search volumes.

搜索引擎优化注意事项
有效的搜索引擎优化始于全面的关键词研究。许多营销人员错误地处理这一关键步骤。例如，在推出鸡尾酒网站时，我花费整整一年时间优化内容以针对"鸡尾酒制作"这一关键词进行排名。虽然我成功占据了英国市场该搜索词的主导地位，但由于每月仅有约500人搜索该短语，该策略被证明效果有限。因此，网站每月仅吸引400名访问者。更优化的策略应该是针对英国市场定位"鸡尾酒配方"，以及针对更大的美国市场定位"饮品配方"，这些关键词具有显著更高的搜索量。

# Keyword Research Fundamentals

Before targeting keywords, thorough research is essential. This involves analyzing search terms relevant to your website, including search volume, competition levels, and commercial value. Essentially, it's about understanding supply, demand, and value – fundamental economic principles applied to SEO.

在进行关键词研究时，首先需要全面分析与你网站相关的搜索词。这包括研究搜索量、竞争程度以及商业价值。本质上，这是将供需关系和价值评估这些基本经济学原理应用于搜索引擎优化。

## Implementation Tools

Effective keyword research requires utilizing specialized tools. The Google AdWords Keyword Planner consistently proves to be among the most valuable resources for this purpose.

实施关键词研究需要借助专业工具。Google广告关键词规划师始终被证明是最有效的工具之一。

## The Role of Backlinks

After completing keyword research, acquiring quality backlinks becomes crucial. PageRank fundamentally drives SEO, as Google's algorithm heavily weights website authority. While modern algorithms incorporate additional factors like user engagement metrics, authoritative links remain paramount.

完成关键词研究后，获取高质量反向链接至关重要。网页排名是SEO的核心驱动力，因为谷歌算法高度重视网站权威性。尽管现代算法包含用户参与度等额外因素，但权威链接仍然至关重要。

# SEO Strategy Overview

When optimizing your website, it is crucial to understand the distribution of anchor text linking to your site. If you misuse this by spamming, it can trigger spam penalties. Tactics such as placing white text on a white background or hiding content five pages below the fold are no longer effective. The most important factor for future Google rankings is to acquire valuable links from high-authority websites.

在优化网站时，了解指向您网站的锚文本分布至关重要。如果滥用此策略进行垃圾信息传播，可能会引发垃圾邮件处罚。将白色文字置于白色背景上或将内容隐藏在页面折叠下方多页等策略已不再有效。未来谷歌排名的关键因素是从高权威网站获取有价值的链接。

## Internal Link Distribution

After securing high-quality external links, you must effectively distribute their value across your site through strategic internal linking. This ensures that link equity is properly circulated throughout your website's architecture.

在获得高质量外部链接后，您必须通过战略性内部链接将其价值有效分配至整个网站。这能确保链接权益在网站架构中得到合理流转。

## Facebook SEO Case Study

When I joined Facebook in November 2007, the company had already launched SEO initiatives the previous September. Despite having public user profiles live, these pages were generating no traffic. Upon investigation, I discovered the only access point to any public user profile was through a single footer link on the page.

我于2007年11月加入Facebook时，公司已在当年9月启动了SEO计划。尽管公开用户资料页面已经上线，但这些页面并未带来任何流量。经调查发现，访问公开用户资料的唯一入口是页面底部的单个页脚链接。

# SEO Optimization Case Study

We began by clicking the "About" link, then selected a blog article and one of its authors. By crawling through their network of connections, we were able to systematically reach all associated profiles. Initially, Google had effectively buried these academic papers in search results, considering them low-value content and refusing to rank them.

我们首先点击“关于”链接，然后选择一篇博客文章及其作者。通过爬取他们的关联网络，我们系统性地触达了所有相关个人资料。起初，谷歌认为这些学术论文价值不高，在搜索结果中几乎将其隐藏，拒绝予以排名。

After implementing a single strategic change—adding a comprehensive directory structure—we enabled Google to efficiently index every page on the website. This straightforward adjustment resulted in a hundredfold increase in SEO traffic, demonstrating the significant impact of proper internal link distribution.

我们实施了一项关键改进——添加完整的目录结构后，谷歌便能高效抓取网站所有页面。这个简单调整使SEO流量增长百倍，充分证明了合理内链布局的巨大成效。

## Fundamental Technical Requirements

Basic technical elements like XML sitemaps and proper header configurations represent essential prerequisites for SEO success. These foundational aspects are thoroughly documented online with detailed implementation guidelines.

诸如XML网站地图和正确头部配置等技术要素是SEO成功的基础前提。这些基础要求在网上有详尽的实施指南可供参考。

# Email Usage Trends

Email has become obsolete for people under 25 in my opinion. Young people predominantly use messaging platforms like WhatsApp, SMS, Snapchat, and Facebook instead of email. While email remains effective for reaching older demographics, it holds limited appeal for teenagers and even university students. Consider your own usage patterns: instant messaging apps dominate daily communication while email occupies minimal engagement. Those in tech-centric environments like Silicon Valley may represent exceptions with relatively higher email usage.

电子邮件对于25岁以下人群已经逐渐失去实用性。年轻人主要使用WhatsApp、短信、Snapchat和Facebook等即时通讯平台而非电子邮件。虽然电子邮件在触达年长受众方面仍然有效，但对青少年乃至大学生群体的吸引力十分有限。回想自身的用法习惯：即时通讯应用主导日常沟通，而电子邮件的使用频率微乎其微。身处硅谷等科技中心的人群可能属于例外，他们的电子邮件使用率相对较高。

## Key Communication Channels

When considering digital communication channels, email, SMS, and push notifications all serve distinct purposes. Each channel possesses unique characteristics that make it suitable for specific scenarios. The effectiveness of these communication tools depends largely on the target audience's preferences and behavioral patterns.

在规划数字沟通渠道时，电子邮件、短信和推送通知各自承担不同功能。每种渠道都具有独特属性，使其适用于特定场景。这些沟通工具的有效性很大程度上取决于目标受众的偏好和行为模式。

# Email Deliverability Fundamentals

All email systems operate under the same fundamental principles and face deliverability challenges. To achieve success, your primary objective must be ensuring message delivery. Your emails must reliably reach recipients' inboxes to be effective.

所有电子邮件系统都遵循相同的基本原则并面临可送达性挑战。要取得成功，您的首要目标必须是确保邮件送达。您的电子邮件必须可靠地到达收件人的收件箱才能发挥作用。

## Critical Factors Affecting Deliverability

Sending excessive spam can result in compromised IP addresses, particularly when using shared servers where other users engage in spam activities. Similarly, sending email notifications from shared servers contaminated by spam senders will consistently route your messages to spam folders, causing complete delivery failure. This may ultimately lead to blocked senders and bounced emails.

发送过多垃圾邮件可能导致IP地址信誉受损，特别是在使用共享服务器且其他用户从事垃圾邮件活动时。同样，从被垃圾邮件发送者污染的共享服务器发送电子邮件通知，将持续导致您的邮件被归类为垃圾邮件，造成完全投递失败。这种情况最终可能导致发件人被屏蔽和邮件退回。

## Monitoring and Response Strategies

Effective email delivery requires vigilant monitoring of system feedback. When receiving responses from destination servers, distinguish between 500-series and 400-series error codes, and handle them appropriately. For hard bounces, implement a single retry attempt while respecting server indications.

有效的邮件投递需要对系统反馈保持警惕监控。当收到目标服务器的响应时，应区分500系列和400系列错误代码，并采取相应处理措施。对于硬退回情况，在尊重服务器提示的前提下实施单次重试策略。

# Email Marketing Best Practices

If you repeatedly send unsolicited emails, email providers will flag your account as spam. Once your domain gets listed on spam blocklists like Spamhaus, it becomes extremely difficult to restore your deliverability. Maintaining high-quality email practices is crucial for long-term deliverability, as this principle equally applies to push notifications and SMS marketing.

如果你反复发送未经请求的电子邮件，电子邮件服务商会将你的账户标记为垃圾邮件。一旦你的域名被列入像Spamhaus这样的垃圾邮件黑名单，恢复邮件送达能力将变得极其困难。保持高质量的电子邮件实践对于长期可送达性至关重要，这一原则同样适用于推送通知和短信营销。

## SMS Marketing Considerations

With SMS marketing, some companies attempt to bypass regulations by purchasing gray route traffic through devices with multiple SIM cards. While such methods might work temporarily, they inevitably get shut down. I have witnessed numerous companies make the mistake of believing these tactics will sustain growth, when in reality they compromise long-term deliverability for both email and SMS campaigns.

在短信营销中，有些公司试图通过购买灰色路由流量（使用多SIM卡设备）来规避监管。虽然这种方法可能暂时有效，但最终都会被封禁。我目睹过许多公司犯下这样的错误——认为这些策略能够维持增长，实际上却以牺牲邮件和短信的长期可送达性为代价。

# Push Notification Strategy

Your push notifications must first be successfully delivered. However, you will never achieve meaningful success by spamming your power users. While this differs slightly from my earlier point, the reality is that bombarding your most engaged users with irrelevant notifications—while making it exceedingly difficult for them to opt out—leads to negative outcomes. When users find no straightforward settings to unsubscribe, they often resort to blocking your notifications entirely.

你的推送通知首先必须确保成功送达。然而，通过骚扰你的核心用户永远不会获得真正的成功。尽管这与我之前的说法略有不同，但现实是：向高活跃度用户发送他们不关心的通知，同时使退订流程极其复杂，会导致负面结果。当用户找不到简单的退订设置时，他们往往会选择完全屏蔽你的通知。

Once users opt out of your push notifications, you lose the ability to reach them through that channel. Moreover, it becomes exceptionally challenging to persuade them to re-enable notifications after they have been turned off. Therefore, the primary consideration for email, SMS, and push notifications is ensuring delivery. Beyond that, key metrics to focus on include open rates and click-through rates. Crafting compelling subject lines is crucial to capturing user attention and encouraging engagement.

一旦用户选择退出推送通知，你将永久失去通过该渠道触达他们的机会。更关键的是，一旦通知被关闭，重新促使用户开启的难度极高。因此，对于邮件、短信和推送通知，首要任务是保证送达率。在此基础之上，需要重点关注打开率和点击率等核心指标。设计吸引人的标题对于抓住用户注意力、提升互动意愿至关重要。

# Email Marketing Strategy

When crafting emails, the key challenge is motivating recipients to click through upon opening. Many marketers mistakenly focus on creating promotional emails that ultimately end up as spam. In my view, traditional newsletters are ineffective because they deliver identical content to all subscribers regardless of their engagement history.

在撰写电子邮件时，关键挑战在于如何激励收件人在打开邮件后进行点击。许多营销人员错误地专注于创建最终沦为垃圾邮件的促销内容。在我看来，传统简报效果不佳，因为它们向所有订阅者发送相同内容，而忽略了用户参与度的差异。

## The Power of Targeted Notifications

The most effective email approach involves personalized notifications. Rather than blanket newsletters, consider what specific updates would genuinely benefit different user segments. A new subscriber who joined yesterday requires completely different messaging than someone who has actively used your product for three years.

最有效的邮件策略应当采用个性化通知。与其发送通用简报，不如思考哪些具体更新能真正惠及不同用户群体。昨天刚加入的新订阅者所需的信息，与活跃使用产品三年的用户完全不同。

### Understanding User Context

We often approach email notifications with the wrong perspective. As an established Facebook user, I don't need emails about every 'like' I receive due to my large friend network. However, for a new user, that first 'like' notification represents a meaningful engagement milestone worth highlighting.

我们常常以错误的角度处理邮件通知。作为资深Facebook用户，我并不需要收到每个"点赞"的邮件通知，因为我的好友网络庞大。但对于新用户来说，首次获得的"点赞"通知代表着值得强调的重要互动里程碑。

# Marketing Notification Strategy

It was a magical moment when we enabled notifications across all our channels. This significantly increased click-through rates for our emails, SMS, and push notifications. However, we only activated this feature for low-engaged users who weren't returning to the site, ensuring they wouldn't feel spammed. This approach created an excellent user experience.

这是一个神奇的时刻。当我们在所有渠道启用通知功能后，邮件、短信和推送通知的点击率显著提升。但我们仅对不再回访网站的低参与度用户开启此功能，以避免对他们造成信息轰炸。这种策略带来了出色的用户体验。

## Key Considerations for Notification Campaigns

The primary consideration for email, SMS, and push notifications should be determining what messages to send. The secondary focus should be creating effective triggered marketing campaigns. One outstanding example was the email campaign triggered by a user's first cross-border trade transaction at eBay, which achieved exceptional click-through rates.

对于邮件、短信和推送通知，首要考虑的是确定发送什么内容，其次是如何创建有效的触发式营销活动。以eBay为例，当用户完成首次跨境交易时触发的邮件活动，在点击率方面取得了非凡成效。

# Key Principles for User Engagement

It was an excellent approach because it was both timely and contextually appropriate for the user. Therefore, I recommend ensuring deliverability as the top priority. Focus on notifications and trigger-based emails, then extend to SMS and push notifications.

这之所以是一个出色的方法，是因为它既及时又符合用户的情境需求。因此，我建议将可送达性作为首要任务。重点关注通知和基于触发的电子邮件，然后扩展到短信和推送通知。

# Concluding Remarks

We are short on time, but I wanted to conclude with one final point. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. If I receive spam, I may not respond due to our effective spam filters.

时间有限，但我想以最后一点作为结束。如果您有任何问题，请随时联系我。如果收到垃圾信息，我可能不会回复，因为我们的垃圾邮件过滤器很有效。

# Inspirational Guidance

One of my favorite quotes, though cliché, is from General Patton: "A good plan violently executed today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow." This principle has been deeply instilled in us by Harvey and Mark across Facebook: move fast and don’t be afraid to break things.

我最喜欢的一句名言，虽然老套，但来自巴顿将军：“今天猛烈执行的好计划胜过明天的完美计划。”这一原则已由哈维和马克在Facebook全公司深深灌输给我们：快速行动，不怕打破常规。

# Growth Mindset

The key to success lies in your ethos. If you can conduct more experiments than others and maintain an insatiable appetite for growth, you will excel. Fight relentlessly for every additional user, staying up late to acquire them, run tests, gather data, and repeat this process tirelessly. Through such persistent effort, your growth will accelerate.

成功的关键在于你的信念。如果你能比他人进行更多实验，并保持对成长的不懈渴望，你就能脱颖而出。为每一位新增用户全力以赴，熬夜获取用户、开展测试、收集数据，并持续重复这一过程。凭借这种坚持不懈的努力，你的成长速度将会加快。

Marcus remarked that we succeeded because we desired it more intensely, and I firmly believe this to be true. Our achievement wasn't due to extraordinary intelligence or prior exceptional experiences; rather, it resulted from extremely hard work and rapid execution. I strongly urge you to adopt the same approach.

Marcus曾评论说我们之所以成功，是因为我们拥有更强烈的渴望，我深信这一点。我们的成就并非来自超凡的智慧或过往的特殊经历，而是源于极其努力的工作和快速的执行力。我强烈建议你采取同样的方法。

Remember, growth is a choice that requires active pursuit. Thank you.

请记住，成长是需要主动追求的选择。谢谢。
