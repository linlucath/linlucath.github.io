So when Sam originally sent me an email to do this course, he said Ben can you teach a 15 minute course on management. And I immediately thought to myself, wow, I just wrote a 300 page book on management, so that book was entirely too long. And I didn't actually have time to collapse the 300 pages into 50 minutes. So like Mark Twain, I didn't have time to write a good short letter, so I'm going to write a long letter. But in this case, I'm going to teach exactly one management concept. So, one long thing. And this management concept though, is the thing that I see CEOs mess up more consistently than anything else, and from when they're very, very early to when they're very, very big as a company. It's the easiest thing to say, and the most difficult to master.

当萨姆最初发邮件邀请我开设这门课程时，他说："本，你能教一个15分钟的管理课程吗？"我立刻心想，哇，我刚写完一本300页的管理学著作，看来那本书确实太长了。实际上我也没有时间把300页内容压缩成50分钟的课程。就像马克·吐温说的，我没时间写一封简短的好信，所以只能写封长信。但这次情况不同，我打算只讲授一个管理概念。也就是说，一个很长的概念。然而这个管理概念，正是我观察到CEO们最容易持续犯错的地方，无论公司处于初创期还是成熟期。这是最容易说出口，却最难精通的概念。

When you're making a critical decision, you have to understand how it's going to be interpreted from all points of view, not just your point of view and not just the person you're talking to, but to people who aren't in the room, everybody else. In other words, you really have to be able, when making critical decisions, to see the decision through the eyes of the company, and the company as a whole, which means you've got to kind of add up every employee's view, and then incorporate that into

当你做出关键决策时，必须理解这个决策会如何被所有相关方解读，不仅是你自己的观点，也不仅是与你对话的人，还包括不在场的所有人。换句话说，在制定关键决策时，你必须能够通过公司的视角，从公司整体出发来看待决策，这意味着你需要综合每位员工的看法，并将其融入

and then incorporate that into your own view, otherwise your management decisions are going to have very weird side effects and potentially very dangerous consequences. It's a really hard thing to do because at the point when you're making a decision you're often under a great deal of pressure.

So let's get into the agenda. I'm going to cover four cases. First I'm going to cover demotions which is a very emotional thing. Then raises which is also an emotional thing. Then we're going to evaluate one of Sam's blog posts which is news to Sam so I figured I'd tease him since he invited me to do a 50 minute management class after I wrote a 300 page book. And then I'm going to talk about history's greatest practitioner at this and I'm wearing a shirt with him on it and how he used it to do something he had never done before in human history and has never done since in human history but basically complete mastery of the technique I'm going to talk about.

So first business example. You've got an executive and do you demote or do you fire him? This comes from an actual conversation an actual real life situation that I was working on with a CEO. The basic situation was this. He had a great executive or like an executive who just a great effort. He hired him. He was working harder than anybody else in the company doing everything he was supposed to. Everybody liked him because he worked so hard and was a general smart person. But he was just in over his head knowledge wise. He did not have the knowledge and the skills to basically do

然后将其融入你自己的观点中，否则你的管理决策将会产生非常奇怪的副作用和潜在的危险后果。这确实很难做到，因为在做决定的时候，你往往承受着巨大的压力。

现在让我们进入议程。我将讨论四个案例。首先我要讨论降职，这是件很情绪化的事情。然后是加薪，这也是件很情绪化的事情。接着我们将评估Sam的一篇博客文章，这对Sam来说是个新闻，所以我想既然他邀请我做一个50分钟的管理课程，而我已经写了一本300页的书，我就逗逗他。最后我要谈谈历史上在这方面最伟大的实践者，我正穿着一件印有他头像的T恤，以及他如何运用这个技巧完成了人类历史上从未有人做到过，之后也再无人能及的事情，基本上完全掌握了我将要讨论的技巧。

那么第一个商业案例。你有一位高管，你是降他的职，还是解雇他？这来自一个真实的对话，一个我与一位CEO合作处理的实际现实情况。基本情况是这样的。他有一位很优秀的高管，或者说一位非常努力的高管。他雇佣了他。他比公司里任何人都更努力工作，完成所有他应该做的事情。大家都喜欢他，因为他工作非常努力，而且是个很聪明的人。但他在知识层面上力不从心。他基本上没有足够的知识和技能去做

He did not have the knowledge and the skills to do what the company needed him to do or compete against the competition, so he couldn't actually keep him in the job. But he's a great guy. So the question is, should I fire this person or can I just move him into a lower role and bring in a person above him? That would be real cool. Let's look at how you make that decision. In this case this was the CEO, so you as a CEO. It's really hard if somebody comes to work everyday at 6 a.m. and is working till 10 p.m., doing it harder than anybody in the company. It's really hard to just say, "Well, sorry, nice effort, but you don't get an A for an effort. You get an F because I fired you." Nobody wants to have that conversation. A demotion is kind of neat because from the CEO's point of view, we can keep him in the company. He works so hard and is a good example of somebody who gives a great effort. He's got a lot of friends in the company, and from a cultural standpoint it's a win-win because he gets to stay and I can bring in somebody that can solve my problem without creating another problem.

他缺乏公司所需的知识和技能，无法胜任工作或在竞争中取胜，因此实际上无法让他继续留任。但他是个很好的人。所以问题是，我应该解雇这个人，还是可以把他调到更低的职位，然后在他上面安排一个人？那样会很不错。让我们来看看你如何做出这个决定。在这个案例中，这是CEO的视角，所以你作为CEO。如果有人每天早上6点就来上班，一直工作到晚上10点，比公司里任何人都更努力，这真的很难处理。很难直接说："好吧，抱歉，虽然你很努力，但努力并不能得A。你得了个F，因为我解雇了你。"没有人愿意进行这样的对话。降职是个不错的主意，因为从CEO的角度来看，我们可以让他留在公司。他工作非常努力，是付出巨大努力的典范。他在公司有很多朋友，从文化角度来看这是双赢，因为他可以留下来，我可以引进能解决问题的人，而不会制造另一个问题。

But I really don't want to be fired, because if I get fired that's a way harder more complicated thing to explain to my next employer than I got demoted. Like, getting demoted is like, well, I didn't really get demoted, I got a new job with a smaller title.
但我真的不想被解雇，因为如果被解雇，向下一任雇主解释这件事要比解释我被降职困难复杂得多。降职就像是，嗯，我其实不是被降职，而是获得了一份新工作，只是头衔变小了。

And then, the last thing is it enables, theoretically, while the company values all our employees, we brought you in and made a commitment to you as an employee. We value everybody, and it will enable you to keep growing with the company.
最后，从理论上讲，虽然公司重视所有员工，我们招聘了你并对你作为员工做出了承诺。我们重视每个人，这将使你能继续与公司共同成长。

This was the kind of initial conversation I had with a CEO, and I said well wait a minute, let me ask you this: what is the equity package that this exec has?
这就是我与一位CEO的初步对话，我说请等一下，让我问你：这位高管的股权包是多少？

He goes well what do you mean? And I was like, well does he have director level compensation, does he have vice president level compensation? Does he have a point and a half? Does he have 0.4% or what?
他问什么意思？我说，他是有总监级别的薪酬，还是副总裁级别的薪酬？他是有1.5%吗？是有0.4%还是多少？

That kind of gave the CEO pause. He said, well, he does have a point and a half. And I said, okay, so you're an engineer in your company. How do you feel about somebody who used to be the head of sales, who got brought in with a point and a half?
这让CEO陷入了沉思。他说，嗯，他确实有1.5%。我说，好的，假设你是公司里的工程师。对于一位曾经是销售主管、带着1.5%股权加入的人，你会作何感想？

Mind you, you're an engineer, what do your engineers get? They get 0.1%, 0.2%, what are they getting at this point? So how are they going to feel about somebody who's not the head of sales with 1.5% of the company?
请注意，你是工程师，你的工程师们能得到多少？他们得到0.1%、0.2%，他们现在能得到多少？那么他们对一个不再是销售主管却拥有公司1.5%股权的人会作何感想？

He was like oh. And I was like, yeah, oh, because how fair is that? So are you going to take the equity away, are you up for
他说哦。我说，是的，哦，因为这公平吗？所以你要收回股权吗，你准备好

So are you going to take the equity away? Are you up for doing that? Are you up for going back and taking back his compensation? How productive do you think he'll be if you take away his compensation? And then secondly, will people give him the same respect now that you've demoted him? They knew him as this, and now he's this. I knew you when you were head of sales, now you're the regional manager, and you're telling me what to do? You're telling me I need to make that call? It seems to me you got demoted. Who are you to talk to me? I'm an up and comer. I'll be the next VP of sales at the next company. So all these things come into play. When you look out at the end, you may think you're dealing with one person. You may think that this is a demotion, or a firing of one person, and what does it mean according to that one person. But what you're really doing is you're saying: what does it mean to fail on the job? Particularly, the highest paid, highest compensated job in the company from an equity standpoint. What's required to maintain your equity? Is it good enough to put in an effort? Or do you have to get a result? In different situations at different levels, these answers will come out differently. If this had been a person not that was an executive brought in from the outside, but was somebody who you maybe promoted past where they should have been, and didn't ever get that equity, maybe you make a different decision. But you've gotta understand what it's going to mean to

那么你要收回股权吗？你准备好这样做了吗？你准备好回去收回他的薪酬吗？如果你取消他的薪酬，你认为他会有多高效？其次，既然你已经降了他的职，人们还会给他同样的尊重吗？他们过去认识他是这样的，现在他却是这样。我认识你的时候你是销售总监，现在你是区域经理，你还来告诉我该做什么？你还告诉我需要打那个电话？在我看来你被降职了。你以为你是谁，来跟我说话？我是个后起之秀。我会成为下一家公司的销售副总裁。所有这些因素都会起作用。当你最终审视时，你可能认为你只是在处理一个人。你可能认为这只是一个人的降职或解雇，对那个人意味着什么。但你真正在做的是在问：工作失败意味着什么？特别是从股权角度来看，公司里薪酬最高、待遇最好的职位。维持你的股权需要什么？付出努力就足够了吗？还是你必须取得成果？在不同情况下、不同层级上，这些答案会有所不同。如果这个人不是从外部聘请的高管，而是你可能提拔过度、从未获得相应股权的人，也许你会做出不同的决定。但你必须理解这将对

But you've gotta understand what it's going to mean to everybody, not just the person you're talking to. Example two: An excellent employee asks for a raise. This isn't like the last employee. This is a really good employee. So excellent employee asks for a raise. Your first thought is: they're really good, they asked me for a raise for a reason. They ask because they think they deserve it. I want to retain them. I want to be fair. They've done a great job. I know that if I give them this raise, it's going to be all love coming my way. If I gave you a raise, we're good, like we're friends. Look at you, you got a raise. It's awesome. From your perspective, you know what you want to do when somebody asks you for a raise. Now consider their perspective: how would they take it if you gave them the raise? Remember, for the employee to get to the point where they've asked you for a raise, this is not something they just woke up one morning and decided to do. This is something they've thought about a lot, compared their other options, they may have an offer from another company, it's something their spouse probably has been talking to them about. So it's a serious thing. If you give it to them, they're very likely to feel very good about it.

但你必须理解这对每个人意味着什么，而不仅仅是你正在交谈的对象。第二个例子：一名优秀员工要求加薪。这不像上一个员工。这是一名非常优秀的员工。优秀员工要求加薪时，你的第一反应是：他们确实很优秀，他们要求加薪是有原因的。他们提出要求是因为认为自己值得加薪。我想留住他们。我想要公平对待。他们工作表现很出色。我知道如果给他们加薪，他们会对我充满感激。如果我给你加薪，我们关系会更好，就像朋友一样。看看你，你加薪了。这太棒了。从你的角度来看，当有人要求加薪时，你知道自己想怎么做。现在考虑他们的角度：如果你给他们加薪，他们会如何接受？记住，对于员工来说，能走到向你要求加薪这一步，这不是他们某天早上醒来就决定要做的事情。这是他们深思熟虑过的事情，比较过其他选择，可能已经收到其他公司的录用通知，这可能是他们配偶一直在与他们讨论的事情。所以这是件严肃的事情。如果你同意加薪，他们很可能会对此感到非常满意。

They may be paranoid about why you are giving them a raise, but that's very unlikely. Much more and they'll feel like, "I'm sorry, I have to just let the whole thing play." For those of you who don't know, that's Bobby Shmurda and Rowdy Rebel doing the Shmoney Dance. But that's likely the reaction you'll get. So there's a lot of momentum to say yes - they read Sheryll's book, they leaned in, and I'm going to reward them for doing all that. By the way, that book has very good advice, so I'm not knocking on that. I don't want you to be misinterpreting me. However, you have to think about it through the point of view of the employee who did not ask for the raise. The employee who didn't ask for the raise may be doing a better job than the employee who did ask for the raise. In their mind they're thinking, "I didn't ask for a raise and I didn't get a raise, and they asked for a raise and they got a raise. So what does that mean? That means you're not really evaluating people's performance. You're just going well whoever asks, gets. So that means I either need to be that guy who asks for the raise - and that's just not how I feel, I do my work and I don't necessarily want to ask for a raise - or I just need to quit and go to a company that actually evaluates performance." So you could really make the person who doesn't get the raise feel...

他们可能会对为什么给他们加薪感到偏执，但这不太可能。更可能的是他们会觉得，"抱歉，我只能让整件事顺其自然。"对于不了解的人来说，那是Bobby Shmurda和Rowdy Rebel在跳Shmoney舞。但这很可能是你会得到的反应。所以有很多动力说"是"——他们读了Sheryll的书，他们积极进取，我要奖励他们所做的这一切。顺便说一句，那本书有很好的建议，所以我并不是在批评它。我不想让你误解我。然而，你必须从没有要求加薪的员工的角度来考虑这个问题。没有要求加薪的员工可能比要求加薪的员工做得更好。在他们心里，他们会想："我没有要求加薪，也没有得到加薪，而他们要求加薪就得到了加薪。这意味着什么？这意味着你并没有真正评估人们的绩效。你只是谁要求就给谁。所以这意味着我要么需要成为那种要求加薪的人——但这不符合我的感受，我做好自己的工作，不一定想要要求加薪——要么我只需要辞职，去一家真正评估绩效的公司。"所以你确实可能让没有得到加薪的人感到...

So you could really make the person who doesn't get the raise feel pretty pissy about it. And don't think that when somebody's walking down your company doing the shmoney dance that other people aren't going to notice. So they're going to be fired up about that raise. They're saying, "Oh, you can say this is highly confidential that I'm giving you this raise." It's not confidential. And then the cultural conclusion is going to be everybody in your company is going to feel that they now have a fiduciary responsibility to their family to ask for a raise all of the time. Because if they don't, then they may be missing out on a raise that they would have otherwise gotten. And like you talk to any experienced CEO and they will tell you this is true. If you give out raises when people just ask you for them, you will have a lot of people asking you for raises. That is called encouraging behavior. So what do you do? And really, the right answer on raises is you have to be formal. And you have to be formal to save your own culture. And I know this is always the thing that causes people running startups fits. Because it's like, "Well, I don't want a lot of formalities. I don't want a lot of process. I want it to be organic. We want to do yoga. We want to only smoke organic weed." Sorry, that was like a Peter. Peter got very focused on who was smokin' weed a little while ago. But like, the process actually protects the culture because what it does it says, "Look, we're going to look at all the inputs. We're going to have a formal way of saying anybody who wants a raise come talk to me."

你确实会让没得到加薪的人对此感到非常恼火。别以为当有人在公司里跳着胜利之舞时，其他人不会注意到。他们会为这次加薪而兴奋不已。他们会说："哦，你可以说这次加薪是高度保密的。"但这并不保密。最终的文化后果就是，公司里的每个人都会觉得他们现在对家庭负有受托责任，必须时刻要求加薪。因为如果不这样做，他们可能会错过原本可以获得的加薪。如果你和任何有经验的CEO交谈，他们都会告诉你这是真的。如果你在员工要求加薪时就给予加薪，那么就会有很多人来找你要求加薪。这就叫做鼓励行为。那么你该怎么做？实际上，关于加薪的正确答案是必须规范化。你必须通过规范化来保护自己的企业文化。我知道这总是让初创公司的管理者感到困扰。因为他们会说："我不想要太多形式主义，不想要太多流程，我希望它是自然形成的。我们想做瑜伽，我们只想抽有机大麻。"抱歉，这像是彼得会说的话。彼得不久前还非常关注谁在抽大麻。但实际上，流程确实能保护文化，因为它表明："听着，我们会考虑所有因素。我们会建立一个正式的渠道，让任何想要加薪的人都可以来找我谈。"

I'm not going to give you a raise, but I'm happy to hear your story. I'm going to talk to all the people you work with so I get an understanding of it. I'm going to evaluate all the work that you've done so I know where I actually rate you, and what my actual opinion on them is. I'm going to do that periodically, I'm not going to do it daily. But maybe if I were fast moving I'll do it every six months or even maybe once a quarter. And at the end of that process I will tell you what your raise is. I will tell you if you're getting one or if you're not getting one, but I'm not going to do things off cycle. I'm not going to do things when asked. There's one process, and that's it.

我不会给你加薪，但我很乐意听听你的想法。我会和你所有的同事交流，以便了解情况。我会评估你完成的所有工作，从而明确我对你的实际评价和看法。我会定期进行这样的评估，但不会每天都做。如果进展快的话，可能每六个月甚至每个季度进行一次。在这个流程结束时，我会告诉你加薪结果。我会明确告知你是否获得加薪，但我不会在常规周期外处理这类事务。不会因为被要求就临时处理。只有一个固定流程，仅此而已。

When I used to be CEO and had executives, the bigger this gets, the harder this gets because the more aggressive the people working for you are. Because to get to be an executive, it turns out, you often have to be pretty aggressive in this world. And in most companies, that's how you get to that level. You can lobby me all you want after the process is done and I give you your raise, but you know what? I'm not hearing it, because I already went through my process. I got your input going in. I got everybody else's input. I've got so many people, I've got so much money and you got what I believe is right.

当我担任CEO管理高管团队时，公司规模越大，这件事就越困难，因为为你工作的人往往更具进取心。事实证明，在这个世界上要想成为高管，通常需要相当积极进取。在大多数公司里，这正是晋升到那个层级的方式。流程结束后，即便我给你加薪决定后你仍可尽情游说，但你知道吗？我不会再听取这些意见，因为我已经完成了评估流程。我事先收集了你的意见，也获得了其他人的反馈。我管理着众多员工，掌握着大量预算，而你已经得到了我认为公平的结果。

Having a process like that basically gets people to be actually more comfortable. They're more comfortable because they don't always have to be on edge about like am I asking for what I deserve?

建立这样的流程实际上能让人们感到更安心。他们更放松是因为不必时刻担忧自己是否争取到了应得的待遇。

Or am I getting aced out because of who I am, what I look like? I'm not buddy buddy, I'm not at the golf course with you. Or I'm not doing whatever you like to do. I don't have to worry about any of that because I know your process. I know your processes like you're going to evaluate everybody, and then you're going to give them what's fair. And so that's a much better way to handle that. It means that you're actually understanding what everybody thinks, not just the people you're talking to at the moment. Okay, so now we're going to get into some fun stuff. We're going to evaluate Sam's blog post, which actually has some very good things in it, and then there are some things I'm going to discuss.

我是否因为我的身份、我的外貌而被排挤？我不是你的好哥们，我不和你一起打高尔夫。我也不做任何你喜欢做的事。我完全不必担心这些，因为我知道你的流程。我知道你的流程是你会评估每个人，然后给予他们公平的对待。这是处理这种情况更好的方式。这意味着你真正理解每个人的想法，而不仅仅是当下与你交谈的人。好的，现在我们要进入一些有趣的内容。我们将评估Sam的博客文章，其中确实有一些非常好的内容，也有一些我需要讨论的地方。

Most employees have only 90 days after they leave a job to exercise their options, which should cover all cases whatever happens with the company. There are some tricky issues to this, but it's still far better than just losing the assets. I think this is a policy that all startups should adopt. So our question is: was Sam right? Is this a policy that all startups should adopt? Let me first explain again what the policy is. Currently, the way almost every stock option package in Silicon Valley works and in all of startup world is this: your stock vests over a period of time, but if you leave the company, you have 90 days to exercise. If you do not buy your stock in that period, it's not yours anymore. Depending on when you entered the company, this could be a big problem. Many companies today that are valued highly, like Airbnb or Uber, when they bring you in, they show you the 409A price compared to the preferred price. The options they're giving you might already be worth $10 million, but what they don't necessarily tell you is that to get that money, because the preferred is worth $10 million, your options probably will cost you around $2.5 million. When you leave, if you don't have that $2.5 million in 90 days, it's gone.

大多数员工离职后只有90天的时间来行使他们的期权，无论公司发生什么情况，这应该涵盖所有情形。这其中存在一些棘手的问题，但比起直接失去资产要好得多。我认为这是所有初创公司都应该采用的政策。所以我们的问题是：Sam是否正确？这是否是所有初创公司都应该采用的政策？让我首先再次解释这项政策是什么。目前，硅谷和整个初创界几乎所有的股票期权方案都是这样运作的：你的股票在一段时间内逐步授予，但如果你离开公司，你有90天的时间来行使期权。如果你在此期间没有购买你的股票，它就不再属于你了。根据你加入公司的时间，这可能是一个大问题。如今许多估值很高的公司，如Airbnb或Uber，当你加入时，他们会向你展示409A价格与优先股价格的对比。他们给你的期权可能已经价值1000万美元，但他们不一定告诉你的是，要获得这笔钱，因为优先股价值1000万美元，你的期权可能会花费你大约250万美元。当你离开时，如果你在90天内没有那250万美元，它就消失了。

And so Sam was like, wow, that's messed up. And so he wrote a blog post. And he said everybody should change it. And so the first question that you have to ask yourself on something like this is well why is that even, like this has kind of been around since like the 80s so why is a rule like this around for 30 years. And it turned out, Sam, and I don't even know whether he figured this out or just intuited it, but he was right. Like something actually had changed. So up until 2004 there used to be this law called APB opinion number 25. That law was the old way to account for stock options. And it's also the law that all the guys went to jail on. So I got a lot of people who cut a case on APB 25. So I'm glad it's gone because it was a very confusing law. And a lot of people did not understand it. And they literally went to jail. But when that was a law, if you gave somebody ten years to exercise their options you would never have been able to go public. And you would never have been able to be acquired. Because you basically were taking an expense that was tied to your stock price. So basically, the more your stock went up, the more compensation expense you'd have to take. And the worst thing about it would be that you wouldn't know what it was going to be. So it'd be totally unpredictable. So you could never forecast earnings ever. Because your earnings would be a function of all of your stock price. And so the more your stock price went up the more money you would lose.

于是萨姆觉得这太糟糕了。他写了一篇博客文章，建议所有人都应该改变这个规则。面对这种情况，你首先要问自己：为什么这个规则会存在？毕竟它从80年代就开始实施，为什么这样的规则能存在30年？结果证明萨姆是对的——我不知道他是通过分析还是直觉得出的结论，但确实有事情发生了变化。直到2004年，一直存在一项名为APB第25号意见的法规。那是核算股票期权的旧方法，也是很多人因此入狱的法律。我认识很多涉及APB 25案件的人，很高兴它被废除了，因为那是一部非常令人困惑的法律。很多人不理解它，结果真的进了监狱。但在这部法律有效期间，如果你给予某人十年行权期，公司将永远无法上市，也永远无法被收购。因为你实际上是在承担与股价挂钩的费用。基本上，股价上涨越多，你需要承担的薪酬费用就越高。最糟糕的是你根本无法预知具体金额，这完全不可预测。因此你永远无法预测盈利，因为你的盈利完全取决于股价。股价上涨越多，你亏损的钱就越多。

In those days, people did not look through expected stock option expenses, so it just wasn't doable. That's why everybody's agreement was written at 90 days. So that's why it's there. It's absolutely the right thing to question it being there. Are you guys following? Do you get this? This is more complicated than the first two examples but a very important one.

在那个时期，人们不会仔细查看预期的股票期权费用，所以这根本不可行。这就是为什么每个人的协议都写成了90天期限。所以这就是它存在的原因。质疑它的存在绝对是正确的。你们跟上思路了吗？理解这个了吗？这比前两个例子更复杂，但非常重要。

I'm fired, and then I'm screwed. And guess what? I'm going to tell everybody how you screwed me over. And so that's a real reputational problem. So that's something that you've gotta consider in setting this policy. But then you also have to consider the employee who stays. One thing that they're going to ask themselves is, look they're leaving. And every time anybody leaves it's like, was that smart? Because these are people who write, your employees know each other better than they know you. In any company, I don't care what company you are. But often the person they're really working with is going to be the person they know more. And so if that person leaves they are going to go, well like, should've I left too? What did they get, and how does that compare to my deal? And so, if we look at the situation, and we try and analyze it, there is a lot of components to it. So first is, look, companies treat a lot of people around here. And I think, really the average is somewhere around 10%, it's probably getting higher. Particularly if you're in San Francisco, it's getting higher. Just because of the nature of the culture there. And then, Silicon Valley companies dilute, like 6 to 8 or even 10% a year for employee options. And you have to keep in mind that, as mean as it may be, if that employee leaves and can't exercise their options, then those options come back to the pool, where you can potentially give them to people who are already there.

我被解雇了，然后我就完蛋了。你猜怎么着？我会告诉所有人你是如何坑我的。这确实是一个声誉问题。所以这是你在制定这项政策时必须考虑的事情。但你也必须考虑留下来的员工。他们会问自己的一个问题是，看，他们要离开了。每当有人离开时，都会让人思考：这个决定明智吗？因为这些人都是写代码的，你的员工彼此之间的了解比他们对你的了解更深。在任何公司，我不在乎你是什么公司。但通常他们真正共事的人是他们更了解的人。所以如果那个人离开了，他们会想，我是不是也应该离开？他们得到了什么，这与我得到的待遇相比如何？所以，如果我们审视这种情况并尝试分析它，其中包含很多因素。首先，这里的公司对待很多人。我认为，平均比例大约在10%左右，而且可能还在上升。特别是在旧金山，这个比例正在上升。这只是因为那里的文化特性。然后，硅谷公司的股权稀释率每年大约在6%到8%，甚至10%用于员工期权。你必须记住，尽管这可能很残酷，但如果员工离开而无法行使其期权，那么这些期权就会回到期权池，你可以将它们分配给仍在公司的员工。

So your perspective on this is that now there's less dilution. That's something that you have to think about. I'm not saying you have to act on it, but it's something that you have to think about. Secondly, losing all your stock is a very big incentive to stay. And that can be good news or bad news, right? It can be good news in that you get to keep somebody you might have lost. It could be bad news in that you kept them for the exact wrong reason, because they have handcuffs on them. You may get an employee who's worse than not having an employee. But on the other hand, a ten year option on a highly volatile security is valuable. Ten year options are volatility and length. That's the value of an option. Ten years on a startup stock is a big valuable thing. And remember, the employee who stays doesn't get that. The employee who stays just gets the stock. They get that, but they don't get the new job and the new stock. So they get one thing but they don't get both things. You've gotta weigh that in. This is a hard one. I think that it should be reevaluated by every company. I wouldn't go as far as to say it should be adopted by every company. I think you have to think about what you want. I would just offer two alternative cultural statements. One is that we treat employees with the utmost straightforwardness and we're going to be fair.

因此，你对此的观点是现在稀释减少了。这是你必须考虑的事情。我不是说你必须采取行动，但这是你必须考虑的事情。其次，失去所有股票是留下来的巨大动力。这可能是好消息也可能是坏消息，对吧？好消息是你可能留住了原本会失去的人。坏消息是你留住他们的理由完全错误，因为他们被束缚住了。你可能会得到一个比没有员工更糟糕的员工。但另一方面，对于高波动性证券的十年期权是有价值的。十年期权的价值在于波动性和期限。这就是期权的价值所在。对于初创公司股票来说，十年期限是非常有价值的。记住，留下来的员工得不到这个。留下来的员工只得到股票。他们得到了股票，但没有得到新工作和新股票。所以他们得到了一样东西，但没有得到两样东西。你必须权衡这一点。这是个难题。我认为每家公司都应该重新评估这一点。我不会说每家公司都应该采纳它。我认为你必须考虑你想要什么。我想提出两种替代性的文化表述。一是我们以最大的坦诚对待员工，我们会保持公平。

And therefore, like you get ten years to exercise your stock. And like what we said we're going to give you, you're going to get regardless of how rich or poor you are. Like, that's just a done deal. The second way to handle it, which is, and no companies do this. Which is why I actually really like this post that he wrote. Like, you can say up front, like, you're guaranteed to get your salary. But for your stock to be meaningful, like, this, these are the things that have to happen. One, you've gotta vest. Two, you have to stay until, like, we get to an exit, like the company makes it. And or, like you've got to have the money. And like finally, the company's like actually got to be worth something, because 10% of nothing is nothing. And look, the reason that we set the policy this way is like we really value people who stay. So don't join this company like, if you've got another, join another one in 18 months, because like, you're going to get screwed. And like, our policy like guarantees you're going to get screwed on that. And so like, those are two ways to handle it. It really depends on like, you and how you want to run your culture. But again, with all these things, it's just critical to think it through from everybody's perspective. Because when push comes to shove, that's going to matter. It's going to change the outcome of your company.

因此，就像你有十年的时间来行使你的股票期权。就像我们说过要给你的，无论你贫穷还是富有，你都会得到。这已经是既定事实了。第二种处理方式，就是，而且没有公司会这样做。这就是为什么我真的很喜欢他写的这篇文章。你可以事先说明，你的工资是有保障的。但要让你的股票有意义，这些事情必须发生：第一，你必须获得归属权；第二，你必须留到公司成功退出，比如公司取得成功；或者，你必须要有资金；最后，公司必须真正有价值，因为零的10%还是零。听着，我们这样制定政策的原因是我们真正重视留下来的人。所以如果你有别的选择，就不要加入这家公司，18个月后去加入另一家，因为你会吃亏。而且，我们的政策保证你会在这方面吃亏。所以，这是两种处理方式。这真的取决于你以及你想要如何塑造你的文化。但再次强调，对于所有这些事情，从每个人的角度仔细思考是至关重要的。因为当面临压力时，这将变得很重要。它将改变你公司的结果。

But still, if someone gets fired, I still think they get screwed a lot of the time. The other thing that's really important that Sam pointed out is the distinction now is how much money you have, right? If you've got the money, you don't get screwed. You walk away with all, you can buy your stock. You do take some risk, but you can buy your stock. If you don't have the money, you don't have the money.

不过，如果有人被解雇，我仍然认为他们在大多数情况下都会吃亏。Sam指出的另一个重要观点是，现在的区别在于你有多少钱，对吧？如果你有钱，你就不会吃亏。你可以带着所有东西离开，你可以购买你的股票。你确实要承担一些风险，但你可以购买你的股票。如果你没有钱，你就是没有钱。

Now we're getting to the person on my shirt, Toussaint. He was the best at this. And I want to take you through some examples because they're very powerful. First of all, about Toussaint. He was born a slave. And he wasn't just born a slave, he was born a slave in the most brutal place to be a slave, which was in the colony of Santo Domingo, now referred to as Haiti. This was actually a much more severe form of slavery, as were all the sugar growing areas, than even US slavery, which is historically a very brutal form of slavery.

现在我们来谈谈我衬衫上的人，Toussaint。他是这方面最擅长的人。我想带你们看一些例子，因为它们非常有说服力。首先，关于Toussaint。他生来就是奴隶。而且他不仅仅是生为奴隶，他是在最残酷的奴隶制度下出生的，那是在圣多明各殖民地，也就是现在的海地。这实际上是一种比美国奴隶制更为严酷的奴隶制形式，就像所有糖料种植区一样，而美国奴隶制在历史上已经是非常残酷的形式了。

Just to give you some numbers on it, basically over the course of slavery, something like 400 years, a million slaves were brought to the US. And at the end of slavery there were four million slaves in the US. In that same period, to the sugar growing countries in the Caribbean, 2 million slaves were brought over. And at the end of slavery, there were 700,000 left. So from just a quantitative perspective, it was nearly ten times more brutal.

给你一些数字，基本上在奴隶制存在的约400年间，有100万奴隶被带到美国。奴隶制结束时，美国有400万奴隶。在同一时期，加勒比地区的糖料种植国引进了200万奴隶。而奴隶制结束时，只剩下70万奴隶。所以仅从数量角度来看，其残酷程度几乎是十倍的差距。

I'm going to read this to you. I don't know if I quite have time, but I don't care. So but, just to give you an idea, this isn't just like a quantitative thing. I'll read you sort of a description of slavery in Toussaint's area. Whipping was interrupted in order to pass a piece of hot wood on the buttocks of the victim. Salt, pepper, citron, cinders, aloes and hot ashes were poured into bleeding wounds. It's not to heal them, this is to make it worse. Mutilations were common. Limbs, ears, and sometimes private parts, to deprive them of the pleasures which they could indulge without expense. Their masters poured burning wax on their arms and hands and shoulders. Emptied the boiling cane sugar over their heads, burning them alive. Roasted them on slow fires, filled them with gunpowder and blew them up with a match. Buried them up to their necks and smeared their heads with sugar, that the flies might devour them. Fastened them to the nests of ants or wasps. And made them eat their excrement, drink their urine, lick saliva of other slaves. One colonist was known in moments of anger to throw himself onto slaves, and stick his teeth into their flesh. So that's the slavery that he grew up in. And it's really important to understand this. Because to get out of that perspective, was not easy. But he had a vision and his vision was kind of threefold. One, he wanted to end slavery. Two, he wanted to actually take control of the country and run the country. And thirdly, he wanted it to be a first class, world class country. Not just like something that, where he had freed the slaves, but something that could compete on a worldwide basis. And so that was his mindset.

我要给你们读这段内容。我不知道时间是否足够，但我不在乎。只是想让你了解，这不仅仅是数量上的问题。我将给你们读一段关于杜桑所在地区奴隶制的描述。鞭打会被中断，以便用一块烧热的木头烫受害者的臀部。盐、胡椒、柠檬、煤渣、芦荟和热灰被倒入流血的伤口中。这不是为了治愈他们，而是为了让情况更糟。肢体残害很常见。砍掉四肢、耳朵，有时是私密部位，以剥夺他们无需花费就能享受的快乐。他们的主人将滚烫的蜡倒在他们的手臂、手和肩膀上。将沸腾的甘蔗糖浆倒在他们头上，活活烧死他们。用慢火烤他们，给他们填满火药，然后用火柴引爆。把他们埋到脖子，在头上涂抹糖浆，让苍蝇吞噬他们。把他们绑在蚂蚁或黄蜂的巢穴上。强迫他们吃自己的排泄物，喝自己的尿液，舔其他奴隶的唾液。据说有一个殖民者在愤怒时会扑向奴隶，用牙齿咬进他们的肉里。这就是他成长过程中所处的奴隶制环境。理解这一点非常重要。因为要摆脱那种视角并不容易。但他有一个愿景，这个愿景大致有三重。第一，他想结束奴隶制。第二，他实际上想要控制并治理这个国家。第三，他希望它成为一个一流的、世界级的国家。不仅仅是解放了奴隶的地方，而是能够在世界范围内竞争的地方。这就是他的心态。

But that was the background that he came from. For example, in management, one conquers the enemy. So, the kind of sequence of battles that occurred in Haiti, where first he had to defeat the locals. But then, once he defeated the locals, there were several countries that were very interested in taking control of Haiti, principally Spain, England and France. So he had to defeat those armies as well. When he conquered them, he had to decide what to do with the conquered soldiers and the leaders on the other side. To do this, he really took into perspective three different points of view: one, his soldier's point of view; two, the enemy's point of view; and finally, the point of view of the resulting culture, like what kind of country was he building? Because the army was going to be the seed corn for the culture of the whole country. So from the soldier's perspective, I get this: do we get to pillage? Soldiers like to pillage. They get stuff, it's something for their work. And the second thing is, they're trying to kill us, so we should kill them. That's a basic perspective of the people who are fighting for them. So, the most important people to some. Now, I put pillage up there, so a couple things to note. One, I didn't put rape up there. And very interestingly, not only did he not allow rape among his army, but he didn't even allow his officers to cheat on their wives.

但这就是他的背景。例如，在管理中，一个人要征服敌人。所以，在海地发生的一系列战斗中，首先他必须击败当地人。但当他击败当地人后，有几个国家非常想控制海地，主要是西班牙、英国和法国。因此他也必须击败这些军队。当他征服他们时，他必须决定如何处理被征服的士兵和对方的领导人。为此，他确实考虑了三个不同的观点：一是他士兵的观点；二是敌人的观点；最后是最终文化的观点，比如他正在建设什么样的国家？因为军队将成为整个国家文化的种子。所以从士兵的角度来看，他们会想：我们能掠夺吗？士兵喜欢掠夺。他们能得到东西，这是对他们工作的回报。第二件事是，他们试图杀死我们，所以我们应该杀死他们。这是为他们而战的人的基本观点。所以，对某些人来说是最重要的人。现在，我把掠夺放在那里，所以有几点需要注意。第一，我没有把强奸放在那里。非常有趣的是，他不仅不允许军队中发生强奸行为，甚至不允许军官对妻子不忠。

He was actually famous for his army not pillaging, so they were already accustomed to this practice. This was one of the most surprising aspects to conquered peoples. In Haiti, he gained such a reputation that even the white colonists were deeply impressed, simply because he would enter their cities after victory without engaging in pillaging. This approach stemmed from his long-term perspective on culture, which leads to an important conclusion. He believed that Haiti's culture, being rooted in slavery and sugar plantations, was relatively inferior compared to what he had experienced in Europe when dealing with Europeans. He considered slave culture even more broken than Haitian culture, as it was characterized by extreme punishments like beatings or executions for disobedience. He recognized this as the culture he needed to replace and upgrade. His solution, when conquering British, Spanish, or French territories, was to take the very best people from there.

他的军队以不掠夺而闻名，因此他们已经习惯了这种做法。这对被征服民族来说是最令人惊讶的方面之一。在海地，他赢得了这样的声誉，甚至白人殖民者也深受触动，仅仅因为他在胜利后进入他们的城市而不进行掠夺。这种做法源于他对文化的长远视角，这引出了一个重要结论。他认为海地的文化植根于奴隶制和甘蔗种植园，与他与欧洲人打交道时在欧洲所经历的相比相对低劣。他认为奴隶文化比海地文化更加破碎，因为它以极端惩罚为特征，如不服从就殴打或处决。他认识到这是他需要替换和升级的文化。他的解决方案是，在征服英国、西班牙或法国领土时，从那里带走最优秀的人才。

He would make them generals in his army. You probably didn't expect that. Here are the guys trying to kill him. He's leading a slave revolution. When he conquers the enemy, he actually incorporates them into his army and makes them part of that. Because he wanted the expertise, and he wanted the culture to be at a much higher level. So the second question he had is even more complicated. What do you do with the slave owners? So you're leading a slave revolution. You take control of the country. What do you do with the slave owners? Three perspectives again. For the slaves, if you're a slave and you win the war against the slave owners, you want to kill them. There is no question. And not only do you want to kill them, but that's your land now. We won. From Toussaint's perspective, it was more complicated because he wanted Haiti to be a first world country and sugar was really important and the whole slave economy was the sugar economy. On the other hand he was a slave and he's got to be pretty upset, particularly given the type of slavery. He had to consider that he didn't know how to run a sugar plantation. And he didn't have any business relationships on who to trade the sugar with. But on the other hand, like war, you win the war you get the land. That's a pretty basic rule. So what to do? And then if you look at the slave owner perspective.

他会任命他们为军队的将军。你可能没想到这一点。这些原本是要杀他的人。他正在领导一场奴隶革命。当他征服敌人时，实际上将他们纳入自己的军队，使他们成为其中的一部分。因为他需要他们的专业知识，并且希望文化达到更高的水平。所以他面临的第二个问题更加复杂。你该如何处置奴隶主？你正在领导一场奴隶革命。你掌控了这个国家。你该如何处置奴隶主？又是三个视角。对于奴隶来说，如果你是奴隶并且赢得了对抗奴隶主的战争，你会想要杀死他们。这是毫无疑问的。你不仅想要杀死他们，而且现在那是你的土地。我们赢了。从杜桑的角度来看，情况更为复杂，因为他希望海地成为第一世界国家，而糖业非常重要，整个奴隶经济就是糖业经济。另一方面，他曾经是奴隶，他一定非常愤怒，特别是考虑到那种奴隶制度。他必须考虑到自己不知道如何经营糖料种植园。而且他没有任何关于与谁进行糖贸易的商业关系。但另一方面，就像战争一样，你赢得战争就得到土地。这是一个相当基本的规则。那么该怎么办？然后如果你从奴隶主的角度来看。

This is pretty interesting because they're coming at it from the point of view that he actually had the discipline to understand. They were coming from a cost structure that was predicated on slave labor. So, like, their business didn't work without slave labor. Like, literally if they had to pay people, their cash flow wouldn't work. They paid a lot of money for the slaves up front, and they paid a lot of money for the land. So in their mind, that's how business worked. You can't just change the economics and have it still work, and then they knew they had some power because of the position they were in.

这非常有趣，因为他们是从他真正有纪律去理解的角度来看待这个问题。他们基于奴隶劳动的成本结构来运作。所以，如果没有奴隶劳动，他们的生意就无法运转。从字面上看，如果他们必须支付工人工资，他们的现金流就会出问题。他们预先为奴隶支付了大量资金，也为土地支付了大量资金。所以在他们看来，这就是商业运作的方式。你不能仅仅改变经济模式而让它继续运转，而且他们知道自己因为所处的地位而拥有一定的权力。

Two, you know, the plantation owners kept their land. Three, he defeated Napoleon. He had a booming economy and a world-class culture. Under Toussaint, Haiti had more exports and export revenue than the United States. So that's how successful he was in the revolution. And this is the power of looking at a situation not just from your point of view, but from the point of view of all the constituents, even the people you hate. Which is hard to do when you're CEO, and harder to do when you're leading a revolution. So just, look, in conclusion, the most important thing that you can learn as CEO, one of the hardest things to do is, you have to discipline yourself to see your company through the eyes of the people that you're working with. Through the eyes of the employees, through the eyes of your partners. Through the eyes of the people who you're not talking to and who are not in the room. Thank you. Now for questions. Yes, sir? How do you communicate the message to the rest of the employees? Right. So this is a great question. Yes. So the question is, if you've got to fire the modern executive, one, how do you have the conversation? And then too, like how do you explain it to everyone else? Because like it's clearly some kind of failure. You failed on hiring, you failed on integrating, they failed at their job. Like some, like it's failure. And so, I'd say look, the first thing is, when firing the person, you have to really try to be honest. And you're feeling like you failed. And I think a common reaction is like, then there's a couple common.

第二，种植园主保留了他们的土地。第三，他击败了拿破仑。他拥有蓬勃发展的经济和世界级的文化。在图森统治下，海地的出口和出口收入超过了美国。这就是他在革命中取得的成功程度。这就是不仅从你自己的角度，而是从所有相关方——甚至是你讨厌的人——的角度来看待局势的力量。这在担任CEO时很难做到，在领导革命时更难做到。所以，总之，作为CEO你能学到的最重要的事情，也是最难做到的事情之一，就是你必须约束自己，通过与你共事的人的眼睛来看待你的公司。通过员工的眼睛，通过合作伙伴的眼睛。通过那些你没有与之交谈、不在场的人的眼睛。谢谢。现在开始提问。先生请讲？如何将这一信息传达给其他员工？好的。这是个很好的问题。是的。问题是，如果你必须解雇现代高管，第一，如何进行对话？第二，如何向其他人解释？因为这显然是某种失败。你在招聘上失败了，在整合上失败了，他们在工作上失败了。就像是某种失败。所以，我认为，首先，在解雇这个人时，你必须真正尝试诚实。你会觉得自己失败了。我认为常见的反应是，然后有几个常见的。

going in. of them.
then there's a couple common

One reaction is like, you just suck. And like, so, like, I'm firing you. \***\* off. That's not good because it's not really true. It may be like, you know, you're failing that way. And then another kind of common mistake is just to be like you know, too mushy. It's not you, it's me. And it, like, feels like some kind of weird break up with an ex-boyfriend that you really didn't like. But generally, like, when you hire people it like, you try to hire the best. And you hire people who are qualified to do the job and generally the reason that they fail in the job is you made some mistake in the hiring process and that you didn't match them to the needs of your company accurately enough. That's the number one reason why this fails. And so that's generally a good place to start. To say, like, here's how we are. And here's what I didn't recognize about us and about you when I made the decision. And now, like, it is what it is. So we're going to have to move on. And then when you talk to the employees about it. Like, this is, and this gets different. Which is, look, you can take somebody's job. You have to take their job. And this is something Bill Campbell taught me. But you don't have to take their dignity. And so it's not necessary to get up in front of the company, and say, I blew that \*\*** out. I capped his \*\*\*\*. In fact, that's not good because if somebody feels good about that, like, you know, you might feel like proud of yourself, but like nobody else feels good about that.

一种反应是，你太差劲了。然后就说，我要解雇你。滚蛋。这样不好，因为这并不真实。可能像是，你知道，你在那种方式上失败了。另一种常见的错误是过于感情用事。不是你的问题，是我的问题。这感觉就像和你其实并不喜欢的前男友进行某种奇怪的分手。但一般来说，当你雇佣员工时，你会尽力雇佣最优秀的人。你雇佣的是有资格胜任工作的人，而他们工作失败的主要原因通常是你招聘过程中犯了错误，没有足够准确地将他们与公司需求匹配。这是失败的首要原因。所以这通常是一个很好的起点。可以说，这就是我们的现状。这是我在做决定时没有认识到关于我们和关于你的情况。现在，事情就是这样了。所以我们必须继续前进。当你与员工谈论这件事时，情况就变得不同了。听着，你可以拿走某人的工作。你必须拿走他们的工作。这是比尔·坎贝尔教我的。但你不必夺走他们的尊严。所以没有必要在全公司面前说，我把那家伙干掉了。我让他完蛋了。事实上，这样不好，因为如果有人对此感到高兴，你可能会为自己感到骄傲，但其他人都不会对此感到高兴。

You know, the right thing to do is just like thank them for their work, like let people know that they're moving on. And you don't really have to explain all their personal details. It's more important to leave them with their dignity. And like let them go on to live another day because look, what you say at that meeting? That's their reputation. Because everybody in your company is going to get a call on that person when they try and get their next job, so if you start saying a bunch of BS about them? Like that's not going to be good. And it's not going to get interpreted as like, we screwed up. It's going to get interpreted as you know, he screwed up. And so they're kind of two different things. You have to be very honest with them but you have to make sure you preserve their dignity when you talk to the company.

你知道，正确的做法就是感谢他们的工作，让人们知道他们即将离开。你并不需要解释他们所有的个人细节。更重要的是要让他们保持尊严，让他们能够继续生活。因为想想看，你在那个会议上说的话？那关系到他们的声誉。因为当这个人找下一份工作时，你公司的每个人都会接到关于他的电话，所以如果你开始说一堆关于他们的废话？那不会有好结果。这不会被理解为是我们搞砸了，而是会被理解为是他搞砸了。所以这是两种不同的事情。你必须对他们非常诚实，但在与公司沟通时必须确保维护他们的尊严。

So I was reading your book yesterday and one, like, I started getting heart palpitations because it was so relatable. Sorry about that. Yeah like, elsewhere. And so one question for me, I think for everyone is how did you in particular deal with all the stress? Like, was it, like, meditating, hip-hop. So the question was, how do I deal with all the stress of being CEO. And the answer is I used to be six foot four and good looking. So clearly not very well. I get asked that a lot and I really don't have a great answer for it. I mean, I think that the one, I have a wonderful wife who's sitting right here. So I'll say that. So if you're married to somebody, if you're married to somebody who's supportive, that makes it easier.

我昨天在读你的书，然后开始心悸，因为内容太有共鸣了。对此我很抱歉。是的，就像其他地方一样。所以我的一个问题，我想也是大家的问题，就是你个人是如何应对所有压力的？比如，是通过冥想、嘻哈音乐吗？所以问题是，我如何应对担任CEO的所有压力。答案是，我曾经是六尺四寸高而且很帅。所以显然应对得不是很好。我经常被问到这个问题，我真的没有很好的答案。我的意思是，我有一个很棒的妻子，她就坐在这里。所以我会这么说。所以如果你结婚了，如果你嫁给了一个支持你的人，那会让事情变得更容易。

Yes sir, like 1,000 times easier. If I did not, if I wasn't, I would definitely probably be dead. But the one thing with stress is you've got to keep your focus on what you can do, not what happened to you. And that's a really hard thing to do, because it's constantly, and people are always asking you about it, like, what are we going to do? We're going to die, we're running out of cash. It's all going to be over soon. But you can't focus on that. You have to focus on, okay, like what are my options? What can I do? And where can I go? And the better you are at that, the higher your chance of success. Yes.

是的先生，就像容易了一千倍。如果我没有，如果我不是，我可能肯定已经死了。但应对压力时，关键是要把注意力放在你能做的事情上，而不是发生在你身上的事情。这真的很难做到，因为它持续不断，人们总是问你，比如，我们该怎么办？我们要死了，我们的钱快用完了。一切很快就要结束了。但你不能关注那些。你必须关注，好吧，我的选择是什么？我能做什么？我能去哪里？你在这方面做得越好，成功的机会就越大。是的。

How did Toussaint get the French generals to work for him, like what was his pitch? Oh, so this is a great question. How did Toussaint get the French generals to work for him? And the reason was that they were so shocked that he didn't kill them because they, their perspective is we're fighting the slave army, we're fighting the savage army. They're going to kill us. And so when he said, we're not going to kill you, that was such a shock to their system that it completely reoriented their whole way of thinking. And they actually became much more loyal to him than they ever were to France. And they actually borrowed that technique, interestingly, from Julius Caesar who he had studied. He was a very unusual slave in the sense that his owner recognized how smart he was and put him in the library, because he wanted Toussaint to eventually run the plantation for him.

杜桑是如何让法国将军们为他工作的，他的说辞是什么？哦，这是个很好的问题。杜桑是如何让法国将军们为他工作的？原因是他们非常震惊他没有杀死他们，因为他们的观点是我们在与奴隶军队作战，我们在与野蛮军队作战。他们会杀了我们。所以当他说，我们不会杀你们时，这对他们的体系造成了如此大的冲击，以至于完全改变了他们的整个思维方式。他们实际上变得对他比对法国更加忠诚。有趣的是，他们实际上借鉴了他研究过的尤利乌斯·凯撒的技术。他是一个非常不寻常的奴隶，因为他的主人认识到他有多聪明，把他安置在图书馆里，因为他希望杜桑最终为他经营种植园。

The person that he studied most of all in his masters' library was Julius Caesar. He borrowed that technique from him, but applied it in a much more dramatic context. His army consisted of British, French, Spanish slaves and mulattos. Most of the mulattos in Haiti at that time were pro-slavery, so that was another issue. But his leadership was so great everybody wanted to join him.

他在主人图书馆里研究最多的人物是尤利乌斯·凯撒。他借鉴了凯撒的技巧，但将其应用在更加戏剧化的背景下。他的军队由英国、法国、西班牙奴隶和混血儿组成。当时海地的大多数混血儿都是支持奴隶制的，所以这是另一个问题。但他的领导力如此卓越，以至于每个人都想加入他的队伍。

And so, his army was introducing the bill. The question is, have we built a culture at Andresen Oritz that has differentiated us from all other VCs? Probably not the best question for me. I could ask Sam that. I feel like that's certainly the goal. We've been around for five years now, and the attempt that we made at it is for the rest of the world to judge if we succeeded. In the old days of VC, when I was an entrepreneur, the basic idea was that you'd have an entrepreneur or an inventor, and they'd get a company to a point. At that point, they'd either be ready to be CEO, or you would go find a CEO to replace them and build the company. Our cultural philosophy was that the founder inventor is special, so we're going to design the firm and the culture of the firm to help the founder develop into a CEO. We do a lot of systematic things differently. The two biggest are: all of our partners are founders or CEOs, so that you get somebody with experience. Our original motto is "some experience required," which is a joke. If you were going to advise the CEO, you have to have been a CEO. That's why I like Sam, he used to be a CEO and was good at it.

当时他的团队正在提出这项法案。问题是，我们是否在安德森·奥尔蒂斯建立了一种区别于其他所有风险投资公司的文化？这可能不是最适合我的问题。我可以问问萨姆。我觉得这当然是我们的目标。我们已经成立五年了，我们所做的尝试需要由外界来评判是否成功。在风险投资的早期，当我还是企业家时，基本理念是你有一个企业家或发明家，他们会把公司发展到某个阶段。在那个阶段，他们要么准备好担任CEO，要么你会去找一个CEO来取代他们并建立公司。我们的文化理念是，创始人发明家是特别的，因此我们要设计公司和公司文化来帮助创始人成长为CEO。我们在很多系统性事务上都采取了不同的做法。最重要的两点是：我们所有的合伙人都是创始人或CEO，这样你就能获得有经验的人。我们最初的座右铭是"需要一些经验"，这是个玩笑。如果你要建议CEO，你自己必须曾经是CEO。这就是为什么我喜欢萨姆，他曾经是CEO，而且做得很好。

In the old days, a professional CEO would bring in a network of just tons of people that he would know from all kinds of sources - guys who bought technology at big corporations, important partners in the field like Google and Facebook, people in the press that he or she might know, and so forth. We try to basically build that network on your behalf at the firm, and I think we do a better job of that than anyone else. Those are the ways that we try to be different.

在过去，专业CEO会带来庞大的人脉网络，这些人来自各种渠道——大公司采购技术的人员、该领域的重要合作伙伴（如谷歌和脸书）、他或她可能认识的媒体人士等等。我们努力在公司层面代表您建立这样的人脉网络，我认为我们在这方面比任何人都做得更好。这些就是我们努力实现差异化的方式。

A professional CEO would want to feel like they have all the answers. Like right now you guys are asking me questions, if I don't know the answer I'll make something up because I want you to think I'm real smart. The most important thing is to pause. If you know something is really important and you haven't thought it through, say: "Look, I'm taking this really seriously but I have to pause because I have to think it through from all perspectives and I'm going to come back." I end up doing that a lot just because there are a lot of things that you run into that you haven't seen before. Most CEOs, including myself, learn this the hard way. You walk in and step in it like three or four times. You think: "I'm going to sneak away with this. Nobody's going to see me give them the raise. I'm going to do it and it's going to be all under the covers, confidentiality baby." And then it comes up and blows up in your face three weeks later, or three months later, or even a year later. Once it's a year later, it's a huge problem. You've taken what's a little emotional problem and turned it into a forest fire. We call it the kimchi problem - the deeper you bury it the hotter it gets. It's a Korean joke. But it takes practice. I would say it takes practice and it's very difficult to do. My friend Bill Campbell, this is his big skill.

一位专业CEO会希望自己知道所有答案。就像现在你们问我问题，如果我不知道答案，我就会编造一些，因为我想让你们认为我非常聪明。最重要的是要暂停。如果你知道某件事非常重要但还没有仔细考虑过，可以说："听着，我非常认真地对待这件事，但我必须暂停，因为我需要从各个角度全面思考，我会回来答复。"我经常这样做，因为你会遇到很多以前从未见过的事情。大多数CEO，包括我自己，都是通过艰难的方式学会这一点的。你会陷入其中三四次。你会想："我要悄悄处理这件事。没人会看到我给他们加薪。我要这样做，一切都会保密，宝贝。"然后三周后，或三个月后，甚至一年后，问题就暴露出来，在你面前爆炸。一旦过了一年，就成了大问题。你把一个小小的情绪问题变成了森林大火。我们称之为泡菜问题——埋得越深，温度越高。这是个韩国笑话。但这需要练习。我会说这需要练习，而且很难做到。我的朋友比尔·坎贝尔，这就是他的重要技能。

People always try and describe him to me, and I'm like, that's not him at all. That's not what he's good at. He's good at seeing the company through the eyes of the employees. As I said, if you're good at that, you'll very likely be an elite leader.

人们总是试图向我描述他，但我觉得这完全不是他真实的样子。那些都不是他擅长的领域。他真正擅长的是通过员工的视角来看待公司。正如我所说，如果你擅长这一点，你很可能成为一位卓越的领导者。
