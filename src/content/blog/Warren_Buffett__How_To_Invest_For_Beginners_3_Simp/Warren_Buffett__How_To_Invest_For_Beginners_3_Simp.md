I had started investing when I was 11. I just dithered away until when I was seven or eight nine but so unfortunately I didn't get started till I was 11. But I bought my first stock when I was 11 and then I experimented with a whole bunch of things like timing of stocks and charting and doing all these crazy things it was a lot of fun profitless but a lot of fun and I did that until I was 19. And I read all the books on investing in the public library and just I ate it up it was fascinating to me but I had no framework I was just searching for something I was hoping that little things on a chart would tell me something about what a stock was going to do it was kind of crazy but everybody else was doing it so I figured I'd do it too sometimes you turn the chart upside down you know it still wouldn't help then in 1949 I read the Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham I'd never heard of them up until then and there are really only two chapters in that book that are.

我从11岁开始投资。虽然七八岁时就开始犹豫不决，但很遗憾直到11岁才真正开始。11岁时买了第一支股票，之后尝试了各种方法，比如股票择时、图表分析等疯狂操作，虽然不赚钱但很有趣，一直持续到19岁。我读完了公共图书馆里所有关于投资的书，如饥似渴地吸收知识，这让我着迷，但缺乏系统框架。我只是在寻找某种方法，希望图表上的细微变化能预示股票走势，这其实很疯狂，但既然大家都在这么做，我也就跟风了。有时把图表倒过来看也没用。直到1949年，我读到本杰明·格雷厄姆的《聪明的投资者》，此前从未听说过他，这本书里其实只有两章内容。

that are the key to it but they set my philosophical framework for investing in three ways they're so basic and so simple it's hard to understand how they could be that important but the ten commandments are simple you know the first is that a stock is part of a business i mean you you can't think of a sock as something different it's you value a business and then you divide by the shares outstanding but what you have to think about is what kind of a business are you getting into what are its economic characteristics for its competitors what's its management like all of these things that relate to a business instead of a little ticker symbol i used to know when i was 11 or 12 the ticker symbols of every company virtually on the new york stock exchange i could mark the boards of harris up them you know but i didn't know anything i mean i could you know i knew that x was u.s steel and t was at t and so on but i didn't i didn't know anything i didn't know what was behind them so i had to start looking at

这些是投资的关键要素，它们从三个方面奠定了我的投资哲学框架。这些原则如此基础简单，很难理解它们为何如此重要，但十诫本就简单。第一条是：股票是企业的一部分，你不能把股票视为不同的东西。你需要评估企业价值，然后除以流通股数。但你必须思考的是：你进入的是什么样的企业？它的经济特征如何？竞争对手情况？管理层怎么样？所有这些与企业相关的问题，而不是仅仅关注股票代码。我11、12岁时几乎知道纽约证券交易所所有公司的股票代码，我能在哈里斯的报价板上标记它们，但我其实一无所知。我知道X代表美国钢铁，T代表美国电话电报公司等等，但我不知道它们背后的实质，所以我必须开始研究

so i had to start looking at at these little symbols or these little names in the paper as businesses and decide how do you value a business what counts the second thing in that in the book is that graham gives you a marvelous set point in terms of how the investor should react to stock market fluctuations he talks about his mythical mr market in chapter eight there's been no better thing written in terms of the investors attitude toward stock prices most people react the wrong way to stock prices i mean they feel good when their stocks go up they feel bad when they go down they think the stock market is there to instruct them and mr market is this partner you have in investing you know he's a remarkably obliging partner this guy comes around every day and he tells you what he'll pay you for your interest in the business or what he'll sell you more at the same price nobody ever does that in in private business if you owned you and i owned a gas station together and i said every day i want you to come in and offer me your half interest in the station

因此我必须开始将这些纸上的小符号或小名称视为企业，并思考如何评估企业价值，什么才是关键因素。书中第二个要点是，格雷厄姆为投资者应对股市波动提供了绝佳的参照标准。他在第八章谈到了虚构的"市场先生"，关于投资者对股价态度的论述堪称经典。大多数人对股价的反应都是错误的，他们看到股票上涨就高兴，下跌就沮丧，认为股市是在指导他们。而市场先生是你在投资中的合作伙伴，他是个异常殷勤的伙伴。这个人每天都会出现，告诉你他愿意出价购买你在企业中的权益，或者以同样价格卖给你更多股份。在私营企业中从来没有人会这样做，如果你我共同拥有一家加油站，而我要求你每天过来向我报价收购你那一半权益。

and i can either buy your half or sell you my my half at the same price and you have to come in every day and do it you'd be at a terrible disadvantage and you'd be at a particular disadvantage if you're mr market in the market because mr market or a friend of the market who obligingly gives you those figures every day different figures at the end of the day in the start of the day but he's naming a price at which you'll either buy herself the beautiful thing about him is that this guy is an alcoholic manic depressive i mean i mean he is as unsound as they come he wanders around all day you know and looks at the crazy things and he you know he he's going to name all kinds of crazy prices and you don't have to pay any attention to them except when it's to your advantage to do so if that's once a year if it's once every five years it's one stock out of three thousand all you have to do is sit there there you have no moral responsibility to this jerk you know i mean he

我可以买下你的股份，或者以相同价格把我的股份卖给你，而你每天都必须来交易，这将使你处于极其不利的地位。如果你作为市场先生身处市场，这种劣势尤为明显——市场先生或市场之友每天殷勤地提供各种数据，早晚数据各不相同，但他会报出一个价格让你选择是否买入。关于他的美妙之处在于，这家伙是个酗酒的躁郁症患者，我是说他的精神状态极不稳定。他整天游荡，观察各种疯狂事物，会报出各种荒谬的价格。你完全无需理会这些报价，除非对你有利时才采取行动。哪怕一年只有一次机会，或五年一遇，哪怕三千只股票里只有一只出现机会，你只需静静等待——对这个混蛋你没有任何道德责任，我是说他

you know i mean he is naming these numbers you didn't ask him to but he's doing it and all you have to do is pick the one time when he is particularly depressed or particularly manic or particularly drunk or whatever it may be and the market will be all of those things and you take advantage of it and that's what's remarkable about stocks if you think about it is that if you look at the high and low on all of these american companies for the last year you'll see case after case after case where the high is twice below now that's for sound american businesses running along paying people selling goods and so on if you go out look at farmland 10 miles from here there's no way in the world over here that the farmland is going to range in value from x to 2x it doesn't maybe go from x to 110 of x or vice versa if you look at an apartment house near here and figures on essentially apartment houses like that over a year it won't it won't move 10 in a given year but here are the finest of american businesses

你知道我的意思是，他在报出这些数字，你并没有要求他这样做，但他确实在这样做。你只需要选择在他特别沮丧、特别狂躁、特别醉酒或任何其他特殊状态的某个时刻，市场就会反映出所有这些状态，然后你利用这一点。如果你仔细想想，股票的非凡之处在于，如果你查看所有这些美国公司过去一年的最高价和最低价，你会看到一个又一个案例，最高价是当前价格的两倍以下。这是针对稳健运营的美国企业而言，它们正常支付员工工资、销售商品等等。如果你去查看离这里10英里远的农田，世界上没有任何可能让农田的价值在x到2x之间波动。它可能只会从x波动到1.1x，反之亦然。如果你查看附近的一栋公寓楼，以及类似公寓楼一年内的数据，它在任何给定年份的波动都不会超过10%。但这里讨论的是最优秀的美国企业

and people just name these numbers that go all over the place and you don't have to play except when you want to that's the important thing and that's the that's what graham tells you the market isn't there to instruct you to tell you anything the markets is there just basically to serve you when you want it to serve you you know one of the most important things remember in stocks very hard to do but people have all these feelings about it the stock doesn't know you own it you know you're sitting there with these certificates for berkshire the company doesn't even know you own it you know and the stock doesn't it's trading now and they don't know you own it so it has no feelings about you i mean you've got all these feelings about it but it's just part of a business if berkshire is worth 75 000 times a million and a half shares you know roughly 110 billion or something like that it's a good investment if it isn't it's a lousy investment you know you have to value the business and graham you know it's amazing but people don't do that in

人们只是给这些到处波动的数字起名字，你不需要参与交易，除非你想参与——这才是最重要的。这就是格雷厄姆告诉你的：市场不是为了指导你或告诉你任何事情而存在的，市场基本上只是在你需要时为你服务。股票投资中最重要的事情之一——虽然很难做到——但人们总是对股票充满各种情感。股票并不知道你拥有它，你拿着伯克希尔的股权证书坐在那里，公司甚至不知道你拥有它。股票现在正在交易，他们不知道你拥有它，所以它对你没有任何感情。我的意思是，你对它充满各种情感，但这只是商业的一部分。如果伯克希尔每股价值7.5万美元，乘以150万股，大约1100亿美元左右，那就是一笔好投资；如果不是，那就是一笔糟糕的投资。你必须评估企业的价值，格雷厄姆说过这一点很神奇，但人们就是不去做。

You know it's amazing but people don't do that in Wall Street. You bet you hear price targets or that kind of thing, but you see no one write a paper that says here is the nature of this business over the next 20 years. You know what will that what should that business sell for, forget about what it's selling for. In fact, one of the things I always like to do when I'm looking at investments is I like to look at them without knowing the price, because if you see the price it automatically has some influence on you. If you just sit down with the reports, if I get an idea about looking up a company and I get these 10Ks and so on, I would rather not know the price because I'd rather value it without knowing the price. When I used to handicap horses when I was a kid, one of the things I would do is I'd get the racing form ahead of time and if there were nine horses in a race, will say obviously the probabilities of each one winning the race had to add up to 100 percent, I mean one horse was going to win the race.

这很神奇但人们在华尔街并不这样做。你肯定会听到目标价之类的东西，但没人会写一份文件说明未来20年这个业务的本质。你知道那个业务应该值多少钱，忘掉它现在的交易价格。事实上，我在研究投资时总喜欢做的一件事就是在不知道价格的情况下分析，因为一旦看到价格就会对你产生影响。如果你只是坐下来看报告，如果我想研究一家公司并拿到10-K报表等资料，我宁愿不知道价格，因为我更想在不知道价格的情况下进行估值。我小时候给赛马做预测时，会提前拿到赛马表格，如果一场比赛有九匹马，显然每匹马获胜的概率加起来必须是100%，我的意思是总有一匹马会赢得比赛。

Absent a dead heat or all of them dropping dead on the backstretch. So if you went through the racing form and I would look at the third race at Hialeah, I would try to figure out the percentage chance of each horse winning the race and that had to add to 100. Then I would compare those percentages to the odds. But I first of all I wouldn't look at the odds first, I would look at the past performance and all that thing first. Stock market's the same way. Third thing in Graham's book is the margin of safety. If you come up to a bridge and it says capacity ten thousand pounds and you're driving a 9,800 pound truck, you drive down further and find another bridge. I mean you know they nobody knows exactly what that capacity is and it may have been signed may have been put up three years ago. So you always leave a margin of safety. You don't try to cut things that close. You wait till something kind of shouts at you in the stock market and with those three principles you can build all kinds of all kinds.

除非出现并列第一或所有马都在弯道猝死的情况。如果你仔细研究赛马资料，比如我会看海亚利亚第三场比赛，我会计算每匹马获胜的百分比概率，这些概率加起来必须等于100。然后我会将这些概率与赔率进行比较。但首先我不会先看赔率，我会先看过往表现等所有因素。股票市场也是同样的道理。格雷厄姆书中的第三个概念是安全边际。当你遇到一座标着承重一万磅的桥，而你开着9800磅的卡车时，你会继续往前开寻找另一座桥。我的意思是没人确切知道那个承重标准是多少，而且这个标识可能是三年前设立的。所以你总要留出安全边际。不要试图把风险算得太精确。你要等到股市中出现真正让你眼前一亮的机会。凭借这三条原则，你就能构建各种投资组合。

all kinds of structures on that but that's the foundation and if you've got that in mind and that's in the intelligent investor i've never found anything that remotely compares with all three of the ones i just you can't get rid of one leg of the three-legged stool and still have a good investment philosophy but i would say that the most important thing uh over a long period and working with big money uh is to understand the business let's just say for the moment that you were given a million dollars or whatever some was necessary and you could look around knoxville or look around all of tennessee if you want and buy into any three businesses you know between now and a week from now private businesses not trading or anything of the sort you've got a week to do it or you have to give the money back what will you be doing during the next week i mean you can look at all these companies some of them you're quite familiar with some of them you're less familiar with some you know by reputation some of them you know the management some of them you know

虽然可以在基础上构建各种结构，但那就是根基。如果你牢记这一点——这在《聪明的投资者》中有阐述——我从未发现任何能与这三者相提并论的东西。你不能去掉三脚凳中的任何一条腿而仍保持良好的投资哲学。但我要说的是，长期运作大资金最重要的就是理解企业。假设现在有人给你一百万美元或任何必要金额，你可以考察诺克斯维尔周边或整个田纳西州，在一周内入股任意三家私营企业（非上市公司）。若未完成则需退还资金。接下来这周你会做什么？你可以研究所有这些公司：有些你非常熟悉，有些不太熟悉，有些你仅闻其名，有些你了解其管理层。

some of them you know you know their competitive situation what will you be thinking about during that seven day period how will you actually be screening these companies out i think you look for three businesses and you can't trade them after you buy them you're just gonna you're gonna own the rest of your life you're gonna be looking for businesses that have enduring competitive advantage you don't want to buy a burger king franchise just because nobody's come within 10 miles of it yet because you know wendy's and donald's and all of those will be there pretty soon it isn't necessarily who's earning the most money now you're going to look for something with enduring competitive advantage now that takes a business with some kind of a moat around it because capitalism by definition is a system where every time somebody has an economic castle somebody else is going to come after it's just the nature if you open a restaurant that's successful here in town you know somebody's going to take your menu and probably take your chef maybe cut your price maybe offer a little more parking maybe be a better better okay whatever i mean capitalism consists of

其中一些你知道它们的竞争状况。在这七天期间你会思考什么？你实际上会如何筛选这些公司？我认为你要寻找三种企业，而且买入后不能交易，你将终身持有。你要寻找具有持久竞争优势的企业。你不会仅仅因为方圆10英里内还没有竞争对手就去购买汉堡王特许经营权，因为你知道温蒂汉堡、麦当劳等很快就会出现。现在赚最多钱的不一定是你要找的，你要寻找的是具有持久竞争优势的企业。这需要企业拥有某种护城河，因为资本主义本质上就是一个体系：每当有人拥有经济城堡时，其他人就会来争夺。如果你在镇上开了一家成功的餐厅，你知道有人会复制你的菜单，可能挖走你的厨师，可能降低价格，可能提供更多停车位，可能做得更好。资本主义的本质就是如此。

I mean capitalism consists of going after the other guy's castle. If that's the case, you want a castle with a big moat around it. There's a lot of ways you can have a moat on something. You could have it by patent protection, you could have it by location in certain areas. I mean if you have something in people's mind like Coca-Cola - six billion people in the world, practically all of them have something in their mind about Coca-Cola, largely favorable. They don't have anything in their mind about RC Cola. And if RC Cola spent a billion dollars advertising, they wouldn't have anything in their mind about RC Cola. But they've got something in their mind about Coke, and generally it's favorable. That's why Coke wants to be where people are happy, because they want to be at the theater, they want to be at Disney World, they want to be at the World Series. They want always have you drinking that drink of Coca-Cola while at the same time experiencing happiness. And if they do that, they're going to sell a lot of Coca-Cola.

我的意思是资本主义的本质就是争夺他人的城堡。既然如此，你就需要一个周围有宽阔护城河的城堡。有很多方法可以在某件事物上建立护城河。你可以通过专利保护获得，可以通过在某些特定区域的位置获得。我的意思是，如果你在人们心中建立了某种认知，比如可口可乐——世界上有六十亿人，几乎所有人对可口可乐都有某种认知，而且大多是正面的。他们对RC可乐没有任何认知。即使RC可乐花费十亿美元做广告，他们也不会对RC可乐产生任何认知。但他们心中对可口可乐有认知，而且通常是正面的。这就是为什么可口可乐希望出现在人们快乐的地方，因为他们希望出现在剧院，希望出现在迪士尼世界，希望出现在世界大赛。他们希望你在体验快乐的同时始终喝着可口可乐。如果他们能做到这一点，他们就能卖出很多可口可乐。

and it won't make any difference if somebody is a half a cent less of some serving than coke so that's an enduring competitive advantage and you want it run by honest enabled people don't want to go in with a crook and you don't want to go in with a dope now the best businesses to buy are the ones where you could have a dope in there i mean peter lynch says you know buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it because sooner or later one will you know and and there's some merit to that uh in fact i got a question the other day from this student group and they said you know what's going to happen to berkshire when you go gaga and i said well berkshire's so good that i can go gaga in fact i may even be you know those are the kind of businesses to own so you want but you want a management that's able and honest and then you want a price that's sensible and that's what you'd look for you go around tennessee got a week to do it and you'd immediately screen out a whole bunch of things you just know that they weren't a fertile area

即使某份饮料比可乐便宜半分钱也不会造成任何影响，这就是持久的竞争优势。你需要由诚实能干的人来经营，不想与骗子为伍，也不想与傻瓜合作。现在最好的收购对象是那种即使让傻瓜来经营也能做好的企业。彼得·林奇说过，要收购那些连傻瓜都能经营的企业，因为迟早会有傻瓜来经营。这种说法确实有道理。事实上，前几天有个学生团体问我，伯克希尔在你老糊涂后会怎样？我说伯克希尔如此优秀，就算我老糊涂也没关系，甚至可能早就糊涂了。这就是应该拥有的企业类型。你需要的是能干且诚实的管理层，以及合理的价格，这就是你要寻找的。如果你在田纳西州花一周时间寻找，会立即筛掉一大堆项目，你很清楚那些都不是肥沃的土壤。

you know that's an important thing to be able to do to know just get rid of all kinds of things there was a great article in the new yorker 30 years ago when bobby fischer was playing spassky in famous chess match which drew attention around the world and they examined how the mind could with billions and billions and billions of possibilities how it could group things so it immediately cast it down to where you had like four options and of course when the humans play something like deep thought you know or whatever the latest version is of the computer on that that computer is making maybe 700 000 or a million calculations a second and the human mind is competing against that but the computer is checking every possibility and the human mind somehow has this ability to cast out 99.999 percent of those things that the computer has to go through in order to focus on the three or four possibilities that really make sense and invest things a lot like that's not that tough because there aren't that many companies but you want to cast out all kinds of things.

知道如何摒弃各种无关事物是项重要能力。三十年前《纽约客》有篇精彩文章，当时鲍比·菲舍尔与斯帕斯基正在进行那场举世瞩目的国际象棋对决，文章探讨了人脑如何面对亿万种可能性进行归类，迅速将选择范围缩小到仅剩四类选项。当然，当人类与"深思"这类计算机对弈时——无论当时最新版本的计算机是什么——计算机每秒可能进行70万或百万次运算，人脑却能与之一较高下。计算机在检查每种可能性，而人脑却拥有某种能力，能够剔除计算机必须处理的99.999%的无关选项，专注于真正有意义的三四种可能性。投资领域也是如此，这并不那么困难，因为值得投资的公司本就不多，但你需要学会摒弃各种无关因素。

If somebody told me that my life depended on picking among the Dow Jones stocks a group of 10 that would be the best performers or outperform the index as a whole, I would spend my time thinking of the worst companies in there. I would cast out things and then I would figure I left those behind, and that's an easier way to approach the problem actually than trying to pick the 10 best. If you were thinking about the state of Tennessee, you know there's a whole lot of things you wouldn't examine, you just figure they're too tough. You might decide you know car dealerships were too tough, it's always going to be competitive. Who knows whether Ford or General Motors are going to be selling more cars five years now or whether there's terrorists on foreign, who knows. So you just say I'll give up on car dealers, I'll pick your budget, I'll think about something else. And that approach that you use there is the same approach you really want to bring to the stock market. You've got 3,000 companies tonight you can look at on the New York Stock Exchange, there's a valuation on every.

如果有人告诉我，我的生死取决于从道琼斯指数中挑选出10支表现最好或整体跑赢指数的股票，我会花时间考虑其中最差的公司。我会排除一些东西，然后想着我已经把那些抛在脑后了，这实际上比试图挑选10支最佳股票更容易解决问题。如果你考虑田纳西州的情况，你知道有很多东西你不会去考察，你只是觉得它们太难了。你可能会认为汽车经销商太难了，竞争总是很激烈。谁知道五年后福特或通用汽车会卖出更多汽车，或者国外是否有恐怖分子，谁知道呢。所以你干脆说放弃汽车经销商，我会选择你的预算，我会考虑其他事情。你在那里使用的方法与你真正想要应用于股市的方法是相同的。今晚你可以在纽约证券交易所看到3000家公司，每家公司都有估值。

There's a valuation on every one of them. It'll change tomorrow. You don't have to play once a year. If you have 20 good ideas, if you have five good ideas in your lifetime, to get very rich. I tell students sometimes they'd be better off if they had a punch card when they got out of school with only 20 punches on it. Because then instead of listening to somebody at a cocktail party and then buying some stocks the next morning, they'd really think about every punch. That's all the punches you get. 20 punches is plenty. You just have to make sure that you don't do any of them for frivolous reasons. We never want to buy anything small at Berkshire. It just doesn't make any difference. We want to think about things that can move the needle. And that gets tougher as the capital gets greater. But that's the way to focus on investments.

每只股票都有其估值。估值明天就会改变。你不必每年都进行交易。如果你一生中有20个好主意，或者5个好主意，就能变得非常富有。我有时告诉学生们，如果他们在毕业时拿到一张只有20个打孔位的卡片会更好。因为那样他们就不会在鸡尾酒会上听别人说什么，第二天早上就买进股票，而是会认真思考每一次投资机会。这就是你所有的投资机会。20次机会已经足够。你只需要确保不会因为轻率的理由进行任何投资。在伯克希尔，我们从不想要购买任何小规模的投资。这根本不会产生任何影响。我们想要考虑那些能够产生实质性影响的事情。随着资本规模增大，这变得更具挑战性。但这就是专注于投资的方式。
