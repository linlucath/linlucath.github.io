Questions are never straightforward. The real question is, what is company culture gonna be? You know, culture that we can generally talk about society, about groups, about places or things. Here we're talking about company culture. And so how do one define company culture? We can take the previous definition and modify it a little bit. And so every, this is a hint of how we may want to define company culture. Everyday blank and blank of each member of the team in pursuit of our company blank. And some people have filled these in with different sort of things. The first blank could be assumptions, beliefs, values. My favorite is core values. The second blank for the B blank. People have said behaviors. My favorite, sort of, answer to that is real action, how do you act? And in pursuit of goals, that's kind of weak. In pursuit of big and hairy audacious goals, that's a little stronger. But a better definition is in pursuit of the mission. Now that, sort of, we have that definition, what do we do with it and why does it matter? This is a quote from Gandhi, your beliefs become your thoughts. Your thoughts become your words. Your words become your actions. And your actions become your habits. And your habits become your values. Your values become your destiny. If you don't have a good culture in the company, you can't pursue your destiny.

问题从来都不是简单的。真正的问题是，公司文化将会是什么？你知道，我们通常可以谈论社会、群体、地方或事物的文化。这里我们谈论的是公司文化。那么如何定义公司文化呢？我们可以采用之前的定义并稍作修改。这是一个关于我们如何定义公司文化的提示。团队成员每天为了公司目标而进行的某种行为和某种行动。有些人用不同的内容来填写这些空白。第一个空白可以是假设、信念、价值观。我最喜欢的是核心价值观。第二个空白是 B 空白。人们说是行为。我最喜欢的回答是实际行动，你如何行动？追求目标，这种说法有些薄弱。追求宏大而艰巨的目标，这种说法稍强一些。但更好的定义是追求使命。既然我们有了这个定义，我们该如何运用它，为什么它很重要？这是甘地的一句话：你的信念成为你的思想。你的思想成为你的言语。你的言语成为你的行动。你的行动成为你的习惯。你的习惯成为你的价值观。你的价值观成为你的命运。如果公司没有良好的文化，你就无法追求自己的命运。

If you take the first letter of those words, it happens to help you move faster. Another reason you might think this is all mushy stuff, but it's actually more scientific. Here are indices from 1997 to 2003 of stock market performance for companies in the S&P 500 and the Russell 3000, compared to the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For. They survey all these companies and pick out those they believe are the best to work for. The stock market returns of those companies happen to be 11.8%, which is almost twice that of the other two indices. So there's real power in companies that treat their employees well, where there is a lot of trust and strong culture.

如果你取这些单词的首字母，恰好能帮助你更快地移动。另一个你可能认为这全是感性内容的原因，但这实际上更具科学性。这是 1997 年至 2003 年标普 500 和罗素 3000 指数公司的股市表现数据，与《财富》100 家最佳雇主公司的对比。他们调查了所有这些公司，并挑选出他们认为最适合工作的公司。这些公司的股市回报率恰好达到 11.8%，几乎是另外两个指数的两倍。因此，那些善待员工、充满信任和强大文化的公司确实具有真正的力量。

So, how do you create a set of values and define what it means to be humble? Those are two examples where we created core values in a way that became credible and uniquely tied to our mission. So you go through this process and come up with a few core values. These might be some of them: honesty, integrity, service, teamwork. You might start with three and end up with a list of ten, or even thirty. It's a good start. When Zappos went through this process, we asked all the employees what core values they wanted to identify with, and we came up with thirty-seven. We initially whittled it down to about ten, and it took a year to do this. That's a long time, and you might want to ask why. Well, if you just come up with the word "honesty" - give me a break, everybody wants the culture to be honest. Nobody is going to say they want to be lied to every day. Service - what do you mean by service? There has to be a lot more depth to this than that. Everybody talks about teamwork, but there's a difference in the level of teamwork you see in an intramural sports team versus a baseball team. So how do you dive deeper into teamwork? What are the things that don't work for a team? A lot of it has to do with communications, and a lot has to do with things that people have studied. You might want to go deeper into that. At Zappos, we thought about how there are a lot of smart people in

那么，如何创建一套价值观并定义谦逊的含义？这是我们创建核心价值观的两个例子，这些价值观既可信又与我们的使命紧密相连。你经历这个过程后，会得出一些核心价值观。这些可能是其中一些：诚实、正直、服务、团队合作。你可能从三个开始，最终列出十个，甚至三十个。这是一个好的开始。当 Zappos 经历这个过程时，我们询问所有员工他们希望认同哪些核心价值观，我们得出了三十七个。我们最初将其缩减到大约十个，这花了一年时间。这是一个很长的时间，你可能会问为什么。如果你只是提出"诚实"这个词——得了吧，每个人都希望文化是诚实的。没有人会说他们希望每天被欺骗。服务——你所说的服务是什么意思？这必须比那有更多的深度。每个人都谈论团队合作，但校内运动队和棒球队之间的团队合作水平存在差异。那么如何更深入地探讨团队合作？哪些因素对团队不利？很多与沟通有关，很多与人们研究过的事情有关。你可能想更深入地探讨这一点。在 Zappos，我们思考了有很多聪明的人

At Zappos we thought about well there are a lot of smart people in this room. When they're fighting with each other and trying to figure out who's right and who's not, it's probably not the best use of time. We want everybody to sort of riff off each other and help each other make any idea better. The result is that the company gets a better idea, not that any individual person is right. So we wanted to instill this idea that it's company first, then your department, then your team, then yourself. And how do you do that? We're going to go a level a little deeper than that. There's another element of high performing teams that I really like which is this pyramid that was created by Patrick Lencioni. He wrote this book The Five Dysfunctions of a Team and the reason this is interesting is he talks about the breakdowns of teams. A lot of teams break down because they don't have any trust. Then, even if you had trust, why do you need trust? Well, then if you have trust you can actually have debates and conflict and get to the right answer. If you don't have conflict and debate, people are just, it's the blind leading the blind. How do you know you actually got to the right answer before you sort of commit to something? So, people are not actually willing to commit. They're afraid of committing. And so let's say you get to the next level and you are actually able to commit. Well what goes wrong then? It's usually because people are not held accountable to things that they committed to.

在 Zappos，我们思考过，这个房间里有很多聪明人。当他们互相争论，试图弄清楚谁对谁错时，这很可能不是最好的时间利用方式。我们希望每个人都能相互启发，互相帮助让每个想法变得更好。结果是公司获得更好的想法，而不是任何个人是正确的。因此我们想要灌输这样的理念：公司第一，然后是你的部门，接着是你的团队，最后才是你自己。那么如何做到这一点呢？我们要深入一个层次来探讨。高绩效团队还有另一个我真正喜欢的要素，就是 Patrick Lencioni 创建的这个金字塔模型。他写了《团队的五种功能障碍》这本书，有趣之处在于他讨论了团队的崩溃原因。很多团队崩溃是因为他们缺乏信任。那么，即使有了信任，为什么还需要信任呢？因为如果你有信任，你实际上可以进行辩论和冲突，从而得出正确答案。如果没有冲突和辩论，人们就像盲人引导盲人。在你承诺某事之前，你怎么知道自己确实得到了正确答案呢？因此，人们实际上不愿意承诺。他们害怕承诺。假设你达到了下一个层次，你确实能够承诺。那么接下来会出什么问题呢？通常是因为人们没有对自己承诺的事情承担责任。

First of all, if people are not held accountable to the things that they've committed to, then they can't get results. I would submit to you that if you think about the company as a black box, and results - whether it's financial, whether you produce a great product, or anything like that - as the output, one of the major inputs is the culture of the company. Some other best practices we're going to actually talk about during Q&A because I think this is going to blend into the conversation is that you want to incorporate your mission to values we've talked about that. Performance, you have to think harder, deeper, and longer about your values than you might initially think you need to do. One of the things I think that a lot of companies don't actually do is they interview for a technical fit or skill fit or competency in that realm, but they don't actually interview for the culture fit, and whether someone will actually believe and follow the mission. I think that's a big no-no. You can have the smartest engineer in the world, but if they don't believe in the mission, they're not going to pour their heart and soul into it. That's one of the things where, if you actually start thinking about culture from the interview process to performance reviews to making sure that it's a daily habit, you'll get a lot further with making a great culture. The final point on making it a daily habit, I think culture, just like customer service or fitness, is something everybody wants. Everybody wants to provide great customer service.

首先，如果人们不必对自己承诺的事情负责，那么他们就不可能取得成果。我认为，如果你把公司看作一个黑匣子，把成果——无论是财务成果、优秀产品的产出还是其他类似的东西——视为输出，那么公司文化就是其中一个主要的输入要素。我们将在问答环节讨论其他一些最佳实践，因为我认为这会融入对话中，即你需要将使命融入我们之前讨论过的价值观中。在绩效方面，你需要比你最初认为的更加深入、更加长远地思考你的价值观。我认为很多公司实际上没有做到的一点是，他们在面试时只关注技术匹配度、技能匹配度或该领域的能力，但并没有真正考察文化契合度，以及某人是否真正相信并遵循使命。我认为这是一个很大的禁忌。你可以拥有世界上最聪明的工程师，但如果他们不相信公司的使命，他们就不会全身心投入其中。这就是其中一个关键点，如果你真正开始从面试流程到绩效评估再到确保它成为日常习惯来思考文化问题，你就能在打造优秀文化方面取得更大进展。关于使其成为日常习惯的最后一点，我认为文化就像客户服务或健康一样，是每个人都想要的东西。每个人都希望提供优质的客户服务。

Every company wants to have a great culture. What they fail to do is make it a daily habit. You just can't be fit if you don't do it as a daily habit. Eventually you get out of shape, then you get fat, and then you're like, oh, I got to go on a crash diet to sort of get back into shape. That doesn't quite work. And the same is true with something like culture. So I think we checked all of these off, so we can go into Q and A with Brian.

每家公司都希望拥有优秀的企业文化。但他们未能做到的是将其变成日常习惯。如果你不把它作为日常习惯，你就无法保持健康。最终你会身材走样，然后变胖，接着你会想，哦，我必须通过速成节食来恢复身材。这种方法效果并不好。企业文化也是如此。所以我认为我们已经完成了所有这些内容，现在可以和布莱恩进行问答环节了。

I remember growing up, I also went to college, and my parents were social workers. They had kinda been nervous about me going to art school. They kinda worried that maybe I would not get a job after college, which I'm sure a lot of parents are worried about. So she said, make sure you promise you get a job with health insurance. I ended up starting Air Bed and Breakfast.com, which was the original name. She remembered her telling me, I guess you never got that job with health insurance. The reason I say this though is this: Airbnb was never meant to be the big idea. It was meant to be the thing to pay the rent so we could think of the big idea. And along the way by solving our own problem. In the early days, we had three co-founders: Joe, Nate and myself. I kind of think of one of the reasons we're successful was I was really lucky. I don't think I was really lucky because we came up with the idea of Airbnb. I don't think we're really lucky that we became successful once we had the team. I think we could have come up with a lot of ideas, and been somewhat successful. I think I was lucky because I found two great people that I wanted to start a company with. People I admired, that almost intimidated me how talented, how smart they were. And I think that's one of the first things you have to build a team that is so talented that they kind of almost make you slightly uncomfortable because they know by being with them you're going to have to raise your game to be with them. And then when we were working together in the early days, this is like 2008. The first thing is we were like a family. You think about founders. Founders are like parents and the company is a child. A child will manifest in many ways behaviors that parents have between their relationship. If the parents are dysfunctional and they're not working together, then the child's gonna be frankly pretty messed up. And so you don't want that. You want your culture to be awesome. And so Joe, Nate and I, we're like total family in the beginning. We worked 18 hours a day, 7 days a week. I remember when we were whiteboarding, we worked together, we ate food together, we even went to the

我记得成长过程中，我也上了大学，我的父母都是社会工作者。他们对我去艺术学校有点紧张。他们担心我大学毕业后可能找不到工作，我相信很多父母都有这种担忧。所以她说，一定要保证你找到一份有医疗保险的工作。我最终创办了 Air Bed and Breakfast.com，这是最初的名字。她记得她告诉我，我想你从未得到那份有医疗保险的工作。我这么说的原因是：爱彼迎从来就不是那个宏大的想法。它只是用来支付租金的手段，这样我们才能思考那个宏大的想法。在解决我们自己问题的过程中。早期我们有三位联合创始人：乔、内特和我。我认为我们成功的原因之一是我真的很幸运。我不认为我们幸运是因为我们想出了爱彼迎这个想法。我不认为我们幸运是因为有了团队后才取得成功。我认为我们本可以想出很多想法，并取得一定程度的成功。我认为我幸运是因为我找到了两个我想与之共同创业的优秀人才。我钦佩的人，他们的才华和智慧几乎让我感到敬畏。我认为这是你首先要做的事情之一：建立一个如此有才华的团队，以至于他们几乎让你感到有点不适，因为他们知道与他们在一起，你必须提升自己才能与他们并肩。然后当我们早期一起工作时，这大概是在 2008 年。首先我们就像一个家庭。想想创始人。创始人就像父母，公司就是孩子。孩子会以多种方式表现出父母关系中的行为。如果父母功能失调，不合作，那么坦白说孩子会相当糟糕。所以你不想那样。你希望你的文化很棒。所以乔、内特和我，在开始时完全就像一个家庭。我们每天工作 18 小时，每周 7 天。我记得当我们使用白板讨论时，我们一起工作，一起吃饭，甚至一起去

We even went to the gym together. We may as well have gotten jumpsuits. We didn't go that far, but we were like we were on a mission. I felt like we were like special forces or something, and we had this amazing shared way of doing things with amazing accountability. Then we realized that was like the DNA of the company. At some point, you go from building the product to phase two, which is building the company that builds the product. A lot of the talk is about how you build a product and how you get product market fit. Once people start doing that, now you've got to build a company. It doesn't matter how great your original product or idea is; if you can't build a great company, then your product will not endure. As we thought about this, one of the things we realized is we want to build a company for the long term. Think about it this way: if your company is like your child, a parent wants his child to outlive him or her. It would be a tragedy to outlive your child. I felt it would be a tragedy for us to outlive our company and just watch it rise and fall. We didn't want that; we wanted a company that would endure. To do that, we started noticing companies have something in common. Companies that were around for a really long time had a clear mission and a clear sense of values.

我们甚至一起去健身房。我们还不如穿上连体工作服。我们没到那个程度，但我们就像在执行任务一样。我感觉我们就像特种部队之类的，我们有着这种惊人的共同做事方式和惊人的责任感。然后我们意识到这就像是公司的 DNA。在某个时刻，你会从打造产品进入第二阶段，也就是打造一个能够打造产品的公司。很多讨论都是关于如何打造产品，如何实现产品市场匹配。一旦人们开始这样做，现在你就必须打造公司。无论你最初的产品或想法有多好，如果你不能打造一个伟大的公司，那么你的产品就无法持久。当我们思考这个问题时，我们意识到的一件事是我们想要打造一个长期存在的公司。这样想吧：如果你的公司就像你的孩子，父母都希望自己的孩子比自己长寿。比自己的孩子活得久会是一场悲剧。我觉得如果我们比自己的公司长寿，眼睁睁看着它兴衰，那也将是一场悲剧。我们不想要那样；我们想要一个能够持久的公司。为此，我们开始注意到公司都有一些共同点。存在了很长时间的公司都有明确的使命和清晰的价值观。

They had a shared way of doing something that was unique to them and was really, really special. And so, then, Joanie and I, when we were three people, decided to look around companies. I noticed Apple, you know, Steve Jobs talked about his core value as that he believed people with passion could change the world. And he said our products change but our value never had. And we learned about Amazon. We learned about Nike. We learned about companies in early days. You can even use this to talk about organizations you know even like a founding of a nation has a strong values and a declaration. Then the country might endure longer. As we started realizing like we need to have intention. Culture needs to be designed. And that's kinda how we got connected is because you know, when we were funded by Sequoia. Alfred Lin had just joined from Zappos Sequoia. And I was told Zappos had an amazing culture and we went to Las Vegas and met up with Tony and we learned about it.

他们有一种共同的行事方式，这种方式对他们来说是独特的，而且非常非常特别。于是，琼妮和我，当我们只有三个人的时候，决定去考察各个公司。我注意到苹果公司，你知道，史蒂夫·乔布斯谈到他的核心价值观时说他相信有激情的人可以改变世界。他说我们的产品会改变，但我们的价值观从未改变。我们还了解了亚马逊。我们了解了耐克。我们了解了早期的一些公司。你甚至可以用这个来谈论你所知道的组织，就像一个国家在建立时有着强大的价值观和宣言。那么这个国家可能会更持久。当我们开始意识到我们需要有意图。文化需要被设计。这就是我们如何建立联系的，因为当我们得到红杉资本投资时。阿尔弗雷德·林刚从 Zappos 加入红杉。我听说 Zappos 有着很棒的文化，于是我们去拉斯维加斯与托尼会面，并了解了它。

A founding company needs a set of integrity-driven core values. But what should those be—three, five, six things that are uniquely you? Think about your own life: what truly differentiates you from everyone else? If you could only tell someone three or four things about yourself, what would you choose? When Zappos reached 100 employees they wrote down their core values—was it nine? No, ten core values. The key lesson I heard from Tony was, “I wish I hadn’t waited until we had 100 employees to write them down.” Sam later told me he thought we were one of the only companies that documented our core values before hiring anyone.

一家新创公司需要一套以诚信为基础的核心价值观。但这些到底应该是什么——三条、五条、还是六条独属于你的要点？想想你自己的人生：究竟是什么让你与所有其他人不同？如果你只能向别人讲三到四件关于你的事情，你会选哪些？Zappos 在达到 100 名员工时把他们的核心价值观写了下来——是九条吗？不，是十条。Tony 给我的关键教训是：“真希望我们没等到 100 人才写出来。”后来 Sam 说，他认为我们是极少数在雇第一位员工之前就写下核心价值观的公司之一。

Defining that foundation took us about six months. People asked why we spent so long hiring the very first engineer. We saw that first engineer as importing DNA: if we succeeded there could eventually be a thousand people with that person’s archetype. So it wasn’t about cranking out the next three features; it was about something far more enduring—do I want to work alongside a hundred or a thousand more people like this? You want diversity—of perspectives, beliefs, backgrounds, age—but you do not want diversity of core values. On core beliefs you actually want extreme alignment; that’s the one area where homogeneity is a strength.
搭建这一基础我们花了大概六个月。人们会问：为什么招聘第一位工程师要耗那么久？因为我们把第一位工程师视作“基因”输入：如果公司成功，未来可能会有一千个以 TA 为原型的团队成员。所以重点不是赶紧找个人做出接下来三个要发布的功能，而是更长久的问题——我愿不愿意和一百、甚至一千个这样的人并肩？你确实需要多样性——观点、信念、背景、年龄的多样性——但你不需要（也不应该要）核心价值观的多样性。在核心信念上，你反而需要高度一致；这是唯一应该“同质化”的地方。

To tell you a quick story about our mission, many people describe Airbnb as a way to book a room or book a house when you travel around the world. That's what we do, but that's not at all why we do it. To answer the question of what our mission is, I'll just tell you a quick story that I think describes it. In early 2012, I met a host named Sebastian. We do these meet-ups around the world where you meet with hosts, and I met this host named Sebastian who's probably in his late 50s and lives in north London. Sebastian looked at me and said, "Brian, there's this word you never use in your website." I said, "What's that word?" He said, "That word is friendship. I would love to tell you the story about friendship." I said, "Okay, tell me the story about friendship." He said, "Six months ago, the riots broke out in front of my home and I was very scared. The next day my mom called to make sure I was okay. I said, 'Yeah, mom, I'm okay.' She said, 'What about the house?' And I said, 'Well yeah, the house is okay as well.' Here's the interesting thing: between the time the riots broke out and the time my mom called me was a 24-hour window of time. And in that period of time, seven of my previous Airbnb guests called me just to make sure I was okay." He said, "Think about that. Seven of my guests called me."

让我快速讲一个关于我们使命的故事。很多人将爱彼迎描述为一种在环游世界时预订房间或房屋的方式。这确实是我们所做的，但这完全不是我们这样做的原因。为了回答我们的使命是什么这个问题，我只想告诉你一个我认为能够说明问题的小故事。2012 年初，我遇到了一位名叫塞巴斯蒂安的房东。我们在世界各地举办见面会，与房东们会面，我遇到了这位名叫塞巴斯蒂安的房东，他大概 50 多岁，住在伦敦北部。塞巴斯蒂安看着我说："布莱恩，有一个词你从未在网站上使用过。"我说："什么词？"他说："那个词就是'友谊'。我想给你讲讲关于友谊的故事。"我说："好的，给我讲讲关于友谊的故事吧。"他说："六个月前，骚乱在我家门前爆发，我非常害怕。第二天我妈妈打电话来确认我是否安好。我说：'是的，妈妈，我没事。'她说：'房子怎么样？'我说：'嗯，房子也没事。'有趣的是：从骚乱爆发到我妈妈给我打电话之间，有 24 小时的时间窗口。在那段时间里，我有七位之前的爱彼迎客人给我打电话，只是为了确认我是否安好。"他说："想想看，有七位客人给我打了电话。"

A founding of a should have before my own mother did. I don't know what that says about our guests or his mother more, but in this summer on a typical night or a peak night we would have 425,000 people, 25,000 people staying in homes and living together. And they were coming from 195 countries in the world, which is every country but North Korea, Iran, Syria and Cuba. So when you hear that story, at our core what we're about, that's much more than just booking a room or traveling. What we are about is we wanna help bring the world together. We wanna do that by giving a sense of belonging anywhere you go. So our mission is to belong anywhere. So five years from now, 20 years from now, maybe we're still selling rooms and homes but maybe we're not. But I can guarantee you what we're always gonna be about. It's a sense of belonging and bringing people together and that's the more enduring idea. So when we hire people the first thing we need to make sure is if that's our mission you need to champion that mission. You champion the mission by living the mission. Do you believe in it? Do you have stories about it? Have you used the product? Would you bleed for the product? I used to ask like, crazy questions like, one of the crazy question Sam reminds me of is I used to interview people. So, I interview the first 300 employees at Airbnb which people think I'm like neurotic and that may also be true. But I used to ask them a question which I've now amended. I used to ask them, if you had a year left to live, would you take this job?

一个创始人的母亲本应更早使用我们的服务。我不知道这更多地说明了我们的客人还是他的母亲，但在这个夏天，在典型的夜晚或高峰夜晚，我们会有 42.5 万人，2.5 万人住在家里并共同生活。他们来自世界上 195 个国家，除了朝鲜、伊朗、叙利亚和古巴之外的所有国家。所以当你听到这个故事时，我们核心的追求远不止是预订房间或旅行。我们的目标是帮助世界团结在一起。我们希望通过在你所到之处都给予归属感来实现这一目标。所以我们的使命是随处皆有归属。从现在起五年、二十年后，也许我们仍在销售房间和房屋，也许不再。但我可以向你们保证，我们始终追求的是归属感和将人们聚集在一起，这才是更持久的意义。所以当我们招聘员工时，首先要确保的是，如果这是我们的使命，你需要拥护这一使命。通过践行使命来拥护使命。你相信它吗？你有相关的故事吗？你使用过这个产品吗？你愿意为这个产品付出一切吗？我曾经问一些疯狂的问题，比如萨姆提醒我的一个疯狂问题是，我过去常常面试别人。我面试了 Airbnb 的前 300 名员工，人们认为我有点神经质，这可能也是真的。但我过去常常问他们一个问题，现在我已经修改了这个问题。我过去常常问他们，如果你只剩一年可活，你会接受这份工作吗？

And actually, the people who say yes to that, you probably don't want. Because that's like they should spend time with your family. So I amended it to ten years. Because I feel like you should, whatever. If you knew you had ten years left to live, whatever you want you would do in those last ten years, you should just do. And I really wanted people to think about that. That was enough time for you to do something you really cared about. And the answer doesn't have to be this company. I say, fine. If what you're meant to do is to travel, or if what you're meant to do is start a company, you should just do that. Don't come here. Go do that. And so there's this old kind of parable probably many of you heard of it. About like two men are laying brick. Somebody comes up to the first man says what are you doing? He says I'm building a wall. He asks the other guy what are you doing? He says I'm building a cathedral. There's a job and then there's a calling. And we want to hire people that aren't just looking for jobs. They're looking for a calling. And that's kinda the first value and that's to champion the mission. I'll just, maybe, because I don't want to just take all the time up. I'll talk about just one more, just so we don't talk the whole thing up just about values. The second value relates to being kinda creative and frugal, and I'll tell you a story.

实际上，那些对此表示同意的人，你可能并不需要。因为他们应该花时间陪伴家人。所以我将其修改为十年。因为我觉得你应该，无论如何。如果你知道自己只剩下十年可活，无论你想在最后十年做什么，都应该直接去做。我真的很希望人们思考这个问题。这段时间足够你去做一些真正在意的事情。答案不一定非得是这家公司。我说，没关系。如果你注定要去旅行，或者如果你注定要创办公司，你就应该去做那些事。不要来这里。去做那些事。有个古老的寓言可能很多人都听过。关于两个人在砌砖。有人走到第一个人面前问你在做什么？他说我在建一堵墙。他问另一个人你在做什么？他说我在建造一座大教堂。这就是工作和使命的区别。我们想要雇佣的不仅仅是寻找工作的人。他们在寻找使命。这差不多就是第一个价值观，那就是拥护使命。我可能，因为我不想占用所有时间。我会再谈一个价值观，这样我们就不至于把所有时间都花在讨论价值观上。第二个价值观与保持创造性和节俭有关，我会讲个故事。

Our company was like stories in your company that end up becoming the things people repeat and talk about when you're a 1,000 people. And it kinda embodies, right, it's kinda like your childhood. These things kinda come back later in life. Same thing with a company. So Airbnb, I think Mark said in the last talk that was like the worst idea that ever worked. It really probably was the worst idea, I mean, people thought we were crazy. I remember telling people about the idea. And I remember actually telling Paul Graham, we have this idea, in our interview, we have this idea, it's called Airbnb. He goes, people actually doing this? I go, yeah. His follow up question was, what's wrong with them? So I knew the interview wasn't going well. And at the end of the interview, Paul Graham, I think, wasn't going to accept us. But we told him the story of how we funded the company. And here's how it goes. We were introduced, Michael Siebel, who I believe he's a partner of Y-Combinator. To let people know, introduced me and Joe to like 15 investors in the Valley, including some of the ones that have been here. And all of them said no to the company. They could have bought 10% of the company for like 100, $150,000. They all said no. They thought it was a crazy idea. No one would ever stay in someone's home. So we ended up just funding the company with credit cards.

我们的公司就像你们公司里的故事，当公司发展到一千人时，这些故事最终会成为人们反复谈论的话题。它有点像体现了，就像你的童年一样。这些事情在以后的生活中会重新出现。公司也是如此。所以爱彼迎，我记得马克在上次演讲中说这是有史以来最糟糕但最终成功的想法。它确实可能是最糟糕的想法，我的意思是，人们当时认为我们疯了。我记得告诉别人这个想法。我还记得实际上告诉保罗·格雷厄姆，在我们的面试中，我们有个想法，叫做爱彼迎。他问，真的有人这么做吗？我说，是的。他的后续问题是，他们有什么问题吗？所以我知道面试进行得不顺利。在面试结束时，我想保罗·格雷厄姆本来不打算接受我们。但是我们告诉他我们如何为公司融资的故事。事情是这样的。我们被介绍给了迈克尔·西贝尔，我相信他是 Y Combinator 的合伙人。为了让人们知道，他介绍了我和乔给硅谷大约 15 位投资者，包括一些曾经在这里的人。他们所有人都拒绝了投资这家公司。他们本可以用大约 10 万到 15 万美元购买公司 10%的股份。他们全都拒绝了。他们认为这是个疯狂的想法。没有人会愿意住在别人家里。所以我们最终只能用信用卡为公司融资。

You know those binders kids use to put baseball cards in? So we put credit cards in those because we had to put them all somewhere. That's how many credit cards we had, and we were completely in debt. In the fall of 2008, we provided housing for the Democratic and Republican national conventions. We had this weird crazy idea because we weren't really selling a lot of homes. So basically Airbnb launched, and a year after we launched, I think we had a hundred people a day visiting our website and we had like two bookings, which is generally bad. It's kinda like releasing a song and a year later like three people listen to it every day. It's probably not going to be a very popular song. But I believed in it, and Joe and Nate believed in it. So we were completely in debt, we don't know what to do. We get this idea: we're Air Bed and Breakfast, we're providing housing for the Democratic and Republican national conventions. What if we made like a collectible breakfast cereal for the Democratic national convention? We came up with this Obama, Barack Obama theme cereal. We called it Obama-O's, the breakfast of change. Then we came up with a Republican theme for John McCain. We found out he's a captain in the Navy, so we came up with Captain McCain's: a maverick in every bite. We had 0 dollars, and without any money, we were able to... we tried to call like General Mills, and they told us to stop calling them or they're getting restraining orders, so that didn't work.

你知道孩子们用来放棒球卡的那些活页夹吗？所以我们把信用卡放在里面，因为我们总得找个地方放它们。这就是我们有多少信用卡，而且我们完全负债累累。2008 年秋天，我们为民主党和共和党全国代表大会提供了住宿。我们有了这个奇怪疯狂的想法，因为我们并没有卖出很多房子。基本上 Airbnb 上线了，在我们推出一年后，我想我们每天有 100 人访问我们的网站，但我们只有大约两个预订，这通常很糟糕。这有点像发布一首歌，一年后每天只有三个人听它。它可能不会是一首很受欢迎的歌曲。但我相信它，乔和内特也相信它。所以我们完全负债累累，不知道该怎么办。我们有了这个想法：我们是 Air Bed and Breakfast，我们为民主党和共和党全国代表大会提供住宿。如果我们为民主党全国大会制作一种可收藏的早餐麦片会怎样？我们想出了这个奥巴马主题的麦片，称之为"奥巴马圈"，变革的早餐。然后我们为约翰·麦凯恩想出了一个共和党主题。我们发现他是海军上校，所以我们想出了"麦凯恩上校"：每一口都是特立独行。我们身无分文，在没有钱的情况下，我们试图联系通用磨坊公司，他们告诉我们不要再打电话给他们，否则他们会申请限制令，所以这没有成功。

We came up with a local alumni of RISD who made 1,000 boxes of cereal for us. We ended up sending them to press, and within a week, we got on national television and national news. We made $40,000 selling breakfast cereal. In 2008, we made $5,000 from our website and $40,000 selling the breakfast cereal. I remember my mom asking me if we were a cereal company now. That wasn't the bad part; the bad part was the oddest answer. The reason I tell that story is our second core value is to be a serial entrepreneur. I'm sorry for the cheesy pun, but be a serial entrepreneur. We really believe that constraints bring out creativity. When you raise like $800 million, suddenly all that scrappiness is easy to lose. It's easier for people to tell you they need a $50,000 contract or other things. Whenever somebody isn't being frugal and creative, or they tell me they can't do something, I'll just take a box of cereal. Even just a suggestion that Obama knows they need to be scrappy and frugal. Again, a lot of the founding DNA of your company becomes these values and principles. Everyone knows if you don't give a crap, you shouldn't be here. It doesn't mean you have to give a crap; it just means you have to be here.

我们找到了一位罗德岛设计学院的本地校友，他为我们制作了 1000 盒麦片。我们最终将这些麦片送去印刷，在一周内就登上了全国电视和全国新闻。通过销售早餐麦片，我们赚了 4 万美元。2008 年，我们通过网站赚了 5000 美元，通过销售早餐麦片赚了 4 万美元。我记得母亲问我，我们现在是不是一家麦片公司了。这还不是最糟糕的部分，最糟糕的是那个最奇怪的回答。我讲这个故事的原因是我们的第二个核心价值观是成为连续创业者。我为这个俗气的双关语道歉，但要成为连续创业者。我们真心相信限制能激发创造力。当你筹集到 8 亿美元时，突然之间所有的拼搏精神很容易就会消失。人们更容易告诉你他们需要 5 万美元的合同或其他东西。每当有人不够节俭和缺乏创造力，或者告诉我他们做不到某件事时，我就会拿出一盒麦片。甚至只是暗示奥巴马知道他们需要保持拼搏和节俭。再次强调，公司的创始基因很大程度上就变成了这些价值观和原则。每个人都知道，如果你不在乎，你就不应该在这里。这并不意味着你必须在乎，只是意味着你必须在这里。

And we came up with a local alumni. But we found a local alumni. And you also have to be creative and be like, kinda like an entrepreneur. Super scrappy. And these are some of the values we learn.

我们找到了当地的校友。但我们需要有创造力，要像企业家一样。非常坚韧。这些是我们学到的一些价值观。

And we came up with two really hard things. But the third thing is the biggest problem. The biggest problem of culture is it doesn't pay off in the short-term. In fact, if you wanted to, in one year, build a company and sell it as quickly as possible, the number one piece of advice I give you is to mess up the culture. Forget about it, just hire people quickly. Culture makes you hire really slowly and makes you be deliberate about decisions that in the near term can slow progress. It's kinda like putting an investment into the company short-term. And so, these are the things people never tell you. So it's really about building a company for the long-term and to endure.

我们总结出两个非常棘手的难题。但第三个问题才是最大的挑战。文化最大的问题在于它无法在短期内带来回报。事实上，如果你想在一年内创建公司并尽快出售，我给你的首要建议就是：搞砸企业文化。别管什么文化，只管快速招人。文化会让你招聘速度变得极其缓慢，让你在近期可能拖慢进度的决策上犹豫不决。这就像是对公司进行短期投资。而这些正是人们从不告诉你的真相。所以这本质上关乎如何建立一家能够持久发展的企业。

Now, let's discuss some aspects of culture. Would you hire the person sitting across from you? If our vision is to become the best at what we do, why don't we hire the very best in the world? Every single person is meant to hire someone better than previous hires. You're constantly hiring and raising the bar. You're constantly hiring world-class people. Then we have separate people called core value interviewers who aren't in the same function. If you're an engineer, the core values interviewers are never engineers. We don't want them to be biased and say, "Oh, I know how good they are." They interview just for values to ensure that people care about the same things. We've said no to many really great people because we didn't feel right about them being with us long-term. That's one of the things.

现在，让我们讨论文化的某些方面。你会雇佣坐在你对面的人吗？如果我们的愿景是成为我们所做领域的最佳，为什么我们不雇佣世界上最好的人才呢？每个人都应该雇佣比之前员工更优秀的人。你要不断招聘并提高标准。你要不断雇佣世界级的人才。然后我们有专门的"核心价值观面试官"，他们不在同一职能部门。如果你是工程师，核心价值观面试官永远不会是工程师。我们不希望他们有偏见地说："哦，我知道他们有多优秀。"他们只面试价值观，以确保人们关心相同的事情。我们已经拒绝了许多非常优秀的人，因为我们觉得他们不适合与我们长期共事。这是其中一个方面。

And then they stopped doing Groupon. This is when Groupon was on top of the world. And they cloned us. And we had 40 employees. We had raised $7 million. They cloned us, and they raised $90 million. And, in 30 days, they hired 400 people. And they wanted to sell the company and if they couldn't, they were gonna destroy us around the world. And the problem with Airbnb is if we're not everywhere around the world. Like, a travel site not being in Europe is like your phone not having email, it doesn't actually work. So we were kind of in trouble.

然后他们停止了与 Groupon 的合作。那时 Groupon 正处于巅峰时期。他们复制了我们的模式。当时我们有 40 名员工，筹集了 700 万美元。他们复制了我们，却筹集了 9000 万美元。在 30 天内，他们雇佣了 400 人。他们想要出售公司，如果无法出售，他们就会在全球范围内摧毁我们。Airbnb 面临的问题是如果我们不能遍布全球。就像旅行网站不在欧洲，就像手机没有电子邮件功能，实际上无法正常运作。所以我们当时处境相当困难。

And we had this conversation and there was the pragmatic decision of should we acquire them and then there was the values decision. The pragmatic one should've probably have said buy them because you can't risk losing international. So just guarantee you're gonna get international. But we ended up not buying them.

我们进行了这次讨论，存在一个务实的决定——是否应该收购他们，还有一个价值观层面的决定。从务实角度来说，可能应该收购他们，因为你不能冒失去国际市场的风险。这样就能确保获得国际市场。但我们最终没有收购他们。

And the reason we ended up not buying them is I just didn't like the culture. I didn't wanna bring in this 400 people. I felt like we were missionaries and they were mercenaries. I didn't think they were doing it for the beliefs. I thought they were doing it to make a lot of money very quickly.

我们最终没有收购他们的原因是我不喜欢他们的文化。我不想引入这 400 人。我觉得我们是传教士，而他们是雇佣兵。我不认为他们是出于信念在做这件事。我认为他们这样做是为了快速赚大钱。

And I believe in a war on missionaries would outlast and out-endure mercenaries. And I also felt like the best revenge against an Internet startup, Internet clone was just to make them run the company long term. It's like you have the baby, now you gotta raise it. That's what we ended up doing. And that was a very controversial decision.

我相信在战争中，传教士会比雇佣兵坚持得更久、更有耐力。我还觉得对互联网初创公司、互联网克隆者的最佳报复就是让他们长期经营公司。就像你有了孩子，现在你必须抚养它。这就是我们最终的做法。这是一个非常有争议的决定。

A lot of people are telling me you should buy this company. We didn't, and I think it worked out. Let's see, the last part being how. What percentage of revenue comes from Europe? More than 50%. I think it worked out. All right, anybody have any questions? I can keep going.

很多人告诉我应该收购这家公司。但我们没有，我认为结果很好。让我们看看最后部分的情况。欧洲市场收入占比多少？超过 50%。我认为结果很好。好的，有人要提问吗？我可以继续讲下去。

One other statement we had at Zappos was that culture is decided by your brand evangelists, who are your employees. If you have a weak culture, we often think that companies that hire employees who are deeply passionate create companies that customers are really passionate about. Those are the companies that have strong brands. Zappos had a really strong brand because they have strong culture. Many companies like Google care deeply about culture. They actually have a question: is this person googly? It's meant to be a catchall for whether they fit the Google culture. Google has a very strong culture that is unique to Google. By the way, there's no such thing as a good or bad culture. It's either a strong or weak culture. A good culture for somebody else may not be a good culture for you. I think brand is incredibly important as well. Brand is really the connection between you and your customers. If you have an incredibly strong culture, that can be a whole talk about brand. But if you have a fairly strong culture, then the brand will come through. The final thing to say about brand is that many people when they talk about their brand, they talk about what they sell. For example, if you're Apple, one way of doing it is to say we sell computers, our new screens are larger and it's faster, and they talk about bits and bytes. I remember Steve Jobs had this really important talk where he says the way.

我们在 Zappos 还有另一个观点，即文化是由你的品牌传播者决定的，也就是你的员工。如果你文化薄弱，我们通常认为那些雇佣充满激情的员工的公司，会创造出客户真正热衷的公司。这些公司拥有强大的品牌。Zappos 拥有非常强大的品牌，因为他们有强大的文化。许多像谷歌这样的公司都非常重视文化。他们实际上有一个问题：这个人符合谷歌文化吗？这是一个综合性的标准，用来判断他们是否适合谷歌文化。谷歌拥有非常强大的文化，这是谷歌独有的。顺便说一句，文化没有好坏之分，只有强弱之分。对别人来说好的文化可能对你不合适。我认为品牌也极其重要。品牌实际上是你与客户之间的联系。如果你拥有极其强大的文化，这本身就是关于品牌的完整论述。但如果你拥有相当强大的文化，那么品牌自然会显现出来。关于品牌最后要说的是，很多人在谈论他们的品牌时，会谈论他们销售什么。例如，如果你是苹果公司，一种做法是说我们销售电脑，我们的新屏幕更大、速度更快，他们谈论的是技术规格。我记得史蒂夫·乔布斯有一个非常重要的演讲，他在其中谈到这种方式。

Yeah, so one other question. One other statement we had at Zappos was that culture is decided by your values. To win, this is 1997 when he first came back, wasn't to talk about bits and bytes. The way to win is to talk about what we value. And our core value is we believe people with passion can change the world. And that was how we introduced the Think Different campaign. And so Apple before they had this huge renaissance, which became the most valuable company in the world. They did the Think Different campaign, which is basically saying, this is what we believe in. And if you buy an Apple computer, you're also saying, I believe in this, too. And there would have to be, I think, a deeper core belief and if that doesn't happen, you're a utility. And the utilities get sold at commodity prices.

是的，还有一个问题。我们在 Zappos 还有另一个说法，即文化是由你的价值观决定的。要赢得胜利，这是在 1997 年他第一次回来时，不是要谈论比特和字节。获胜的方式是谈论我们重视什么。我们的核心价值观是我们相信有激情的人可以改变世界。这就是我们推出"Think Different"活动的方式。在苹果公司经历巨大复兴之前，他们成为了世界上最有价值的公司。他们开展了"Think Different"活动，基本上就是说，这就是我们所信仰的。如果你购买苹果电脑，你也是在说，我也相信这个。我认为必须要有更深层次的核心信念，如果这没有发生，你就是一个实用工具。而实用工具是以商品价格出售的。

Go ahead. How did you know how to communicate this idea? How? The question is how do you know how to communicate this to the company? The culture or the core values. To the employees. To the outside world. The culture? The values. The brand? How to communicate what Airbnb does? Well, so the question is how do we communicate what Airbnb does early in the days? Well, we learned a lot because in the early days, we communicate like a utility. We actually said Airbnb is a cheap, affordable alternative to hotels. And we had a tagline of forget hotels, save money with Airbnb. And over time we felt like that was, I mean this was in really early days. And we felt like that was way too limiting.

请继续。你是如何知道如何传达这个想法的？如何？问题是你如何知道如何向公司传达这个？文化或核心价值观。向员工。向外界。文化？价值观？品牌？如何传达 Airbnb 是做什么的？那么，问题是我们早期如何传达 Airbnb 是做什么的？我们学到了很多，因为在早期，我们像实用工具一样进行沟通。我们实际上说 Airbnb 是酒店的廉价、实惠的替代品。我们有一个口号是"忘记酒店，用 Airbnb 省钱"。随着时间的推移，我们觉得那是，我的意思是在非常早期的阶段。我们觉得那太有限制性了。

And there would have to be, I think, a deeper core belief that undercut the idea. And so, we then eventually changed our tag line to "travel like a human", which we haven't kept. But it was basically meant to say that we believe in a certain kind of world and we really feel like travel is mass produced. You feel isolated, you feel like a stranger. And we want to bring the world back to the place where it's a little bit like a village again, where the service is coming from other people. You have this feeling like you belong and you're actually treated like a human. You know, no matter how successful you are in life, often travelling will remind you that you're not that successful. Go through TSA, stay in a typical hotel - sometimes you'll have some problems. And so we really want to make people feel special. This was kind of some of the stuff we did in the early days and we did a lot of storytelling. I probably told the story of Airbnb like 10,000 times. This is something that's kind of related to culture. Somebody asked me the other day what's the job of the CEO. There's a number of things a CEO does, but what you mostly do is articulate the vision. So you articulate the vision, you gotta develop a strategy and you gotta hire people to fit the culture. If you do those three things you basically have a company, and that company will hopefully be successful if you have the right vision, the right strategy and good people. So what we end up doing is articulating the vision over and over and over again.

我认为必须要有更深层的核心信念来支撑这个想法。因此，我们最终将标语改为"像人类一样旅行"，虽然这个标语我们后来没有保留。但这基本上是想表达我们相信某种理想的世界，而且我们确实感觉旅行已经变得工业化生产。你会感到孤立，像个陌生人。我们想要让世界回归到有点像村庄的状态，在那里服务来自于他人。你会感受到归属感，真正被当作人类对待。要知道，无论你在生活中多么成功，旅行常常会提醒你，你并没有那么成功。通过安检，住在典型的酒店里——有时你会遇到一些问题。所以我们真的很想让人们感受到特别。这些是我们早期做的一些事情，我们进行了大量的故事讲述。我大概讲述过爱彼迎的故事上万次。这与文化有些关联。前几天有人问我 CEO 的职责是什么。CEO 要做很多事情，但最主要的是阐述愿景。所以你要阐述愿景，制定战略，并招聘适合文化的人才。如果你做好这三件事，基本上就建立了一个公司。如果拥有正确的愿景、正确的战略和优秀的人才，这个公司就有望成功。因此我们最终要做的就是一遍又一遍地反复阐述愿景。

Whether you're hiring people or recruiting them, talking to investors to raise money, doing PR interviews, or speaking at a class, you're always reinforcing the values. You're doing it in email to a customer, and so you just do it thousands of times. If you do something thousands of times, it will change and get better every time, so it's just kind of evolved.

无论你是在招聘人员、与投资人洽谈融资、进行公关采访，还是在课堂上演讲，你始终都在强化这些价值观。你在给客户的电子邮件中这样做，于是你重复了成千上万次。如果你将某件事重复成千上万次，它每次都会发生变化并不断改进，所以这就像是自然演进的过程。

Yeah, question. The host had to completely fit the values, that we met them, we attract people like us. And so, over time, we've realized host or partners, and so they need to believe in the same values we do. And so now we have a program called the Superhost program where they have to demonstrate values to reach this kind of badge, which gets them kind of priority customer support and distribution. We are having this host convention where you bring all the hosts in. We're gonna be talking about and reinforcing the values. We're moving towards the place where they have to apply to list. And we don't test them the way we test an employee but we're starting to get more rigorous about it. So the answer is, the answer is we were really late but we now do it by gradually moving towards apply to list and reinforcing it every step of the way.

是的，有个问题。房东必须完全符合我们的价值观，我们遇到他们，我们吸引志同道合的人。随着时间的推移，我们意识到房东或合作伙伴需要相信与我们相同的价值观。所以现在我们有一个名为"超级房东"的计划，他们必须展示价值观才能获得这种徽章，这能让他们获得优先客户支持和分发机会。我们正在举办这个房东大会，把所有房东聚集在一起。我们将讨论并强化这些价值观。我们正在朝着要求他们申请上线的方向发展。我们不会像测试员工那样测试他们，但我们开始在这方面变得更加严格。所以答案是，我们确实起步很晚，但我们现在通过逐步向申请上线方向发展，并在每一步都强化价值观来实现这一目标。

When Airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community. Do you have any thoughts on how that contributes to the culture of your development team?

当 Airbnb 为开源社区做出了一些重要贡献时。您认为这对您开发团队的文化有何贡献？

Yeah. I think, just in general, and it may be related to two things about Airbnb. We tend to be a pretty open culture, just in general. We communicate a lot. And we generally believe in the idea of like, a shared world where people are giving back and contributing, making communities and industries stronger. So, just my one philosophy on communication is, we basically communicate and talk about everything internally except for things that relate to employee or customer privacy. So, if it doesn't relate to those two things, we'll basically talk about it.

是的。我认为，总的来说，这可能与 Airbnb 的两件事有关。我们通常倾向于相当开放的文化。我们经常沟通。我们普遍相信这样一个理念：在一个共享的世界里，人们回馈和贡献，使社区和行业更加强大。所以，我在沟通方面的一个理念是，除了涉及员工或客户隐私的事情外，我们基本上会在内部沟通和讨论所有事情。因此，如果不涉及这两件事，我们基本上都会讨论。

As far as open source culture and engineering, we wanted to make sure that we had a really strong identification of the team. And so we really felt like a lot of source codes shouldn't be, you know, we felt like every company needs a moat. Some kind of moat that protects you from your competition. We thought some technology would be, but we also felt like we wanted to be able to get back from a technology standpoint. And we preferred our moat to be that we provide the very best experience in the world when you use Airbnb. We have the biggest network effects. And we thought that kind of took precedent over having certain technology that only we could use. And so we decided to try to share some of that out to people. And I think, again, it does relate to the values. Now one other thing is I never one day recommended. Hopefully, if you have a strong culture, I didn't recommend we do any of that. We hired engineers that we felt like fit the values. And it just independently occurred to them they should do that. They felt like that was the right thing to do.

关于开源文化和工程实践，我们希望确保团队具有强烈的认同感。我们确实认为很多源代码不应该被封闭，我们认为每家公司都需要一条护城河。某种能够保护你免受竞争威胁的护城河。我们曾认为某些技术可以充当护城河，但我们也希望从技术角度能够保持灵活性。我们更倾向于让我们的护城河成为：当您使用 Airbnb 时，我们提供世界上最好的体验。我们拥有最大的网络效应。我们认为这比拥有只有我们能使用的特定技术更为重要。因此我们决定尝试与人们分享部分技术。我认为这确实与价值观相关。另外一点是，我从未在任何一天建议过。希望如果你有强大的文化，我并没有建议我们做任何那样的事情。我们雇佣了符合价值观的工程师。他们独立地意识到应该这样做。他们认为这样做是正确的。

So this is actually not about culture, but I will answer it anyway. So, you know a lot of people, this is not even a culture question, but the best advice I ever got was probably from Paul Graham. And Paul Graham basically said, I remember he had this line. He said it's better, he may have even talked about this at a talk, he said it's better to have 100 people that love you than to have a million people that just kinda sorta like you. It's literally better to have 100 people love you. And the reason why, if you have a million customers or a million users and they just kinda don't care about you but they kinda use your app and you're okay. To get them to care is a really, really hard thing. In fact, I don't know how to get a million people to all of a sudden care. What I do know is if you get 100 people that love you, those people if they feel incredibly passionate, each of them will tell 100 people. And in fact all movements typically start, or companies or ideas that are really powerful, start with just 100 people. So the reason this is so critical is he gave us another lesson. Which is if all you need to do is get 100 people to love you. Then what you need to do is things that don't scale. So it's hard if you have a million people you can't meet all of them. But you can meet 100 people. You can spend time with them. So that's exactly what we did. Joanie and I, we would go door to door in New York City or in Denver where the Democratic National Convention was. Literally meeting with, staying with and living with our users.

这其实与文化无关，但我还是会回答。你知道很多人，这甚至不是个文化问题，但我得到过最好的建议可能来自保罗·格雷厄姆。保罗·格雷厄姆基本上说过，我记得他有这么一句话。他说拥有 100 个热爱你的人，比拥有 100 万个只是有点喜欢你的人更好。他可能在某个演讲中谈到过这个观点。拥有 100 个真心爱你的人确实更好。原因在于，如果你有 100 万客户或用户，他们只是不太在意你，但还会用你的应用，你觉得还行。但要让他们在乎你，真的非常非常困难。事实上，我不知道如何让 100 万人突然都在乎你。但我知道的是，如果你找到 100 个热爱你的人，如果这些人充满热情，他们每个人都会告诉另外 100 个人。事实上，所有运动通常都是这样开始的，真正强大的公司或理念，往往始于仅仅 100 人。这个观点如此关键的原因在于，他还给了我们另一个启示：如果你只需要让 100 个人爱上你，那么你需要做的就是那些无法规模化的事情。当你面对 100 万人时，你无法与所有人见面，这很困难。但你可以见到 100 个人。你可以花时间与他们相处。这正是我们所做的。乔尼和我，我们会在纽约市或丹佛——民主党全国代表大会的举办地——挨家挨户拜访。真正地与我们的用户见面、同住、生活在一起。

I used to joke that when you buy an iPhone, Steve Jobs didn't come and sleep on your couch, but I did. And that was really critical: living with your users. By living with our users and spending time with them, all we had to do is give them enough time and attention, and get them to the point where they were deeply passionate. If you work backwards from 100 people or even one person, without even technology, imagine what would be an amazing experience for just this one person. Walk through the journey from the time they use your service, and make it perfect for that one person. Once you make a service perfect for one person, it's actually really easy to make almost anything perfect for a person. It's not actually that hard. The hard thing is then how do we scale this to millions of people. Where everyone gets in trouble is they try to solve both at the same time. So the first thing we do is get the perfect experience for one person. We went door-to-door to do this, we won over their love. Then we use a separate part of our brain to imagine how we would achieve that at scale. I'll give you one example before I stop talking about this. Right now on Airbnb, if you put your home on Airbnb, you can click a button and it kinda works like Uber. We did this before Uber: a professional photographer comes to your house and they'll photograph your homes for free. We have 5000 photographers around the world, and we photographed hundreds of thousands of homes.

我过去常开玩笑说，当你买 iPhone 时，史蒂夫·乔布斯不会来睡在你的沙发上，但我会。这一点非常关键：与用户共同生活。通过与用户共同生活并花时间相处，我们只需要给予他们足够的时间和关注，让他们达到充满热情的程度。如果你从 100 人甚至一个人开始逆向思考，即使不考虑技术，想象一下对这一个体来说什么会是绝佳的体验。从他们使用你服务的那一刻开始梳理整个旅程，为那一个人做到完美。一旦你为一个人完善了服务，实际上为任何人完善任何事物都会变得很容易。这其实并不难。困难的是如何将其扩展到数百万人。人们常犯的错误是试图同时解决这两个问题。所以我们做的第一件事就是为一个人创造完美体验。我们挨家挨户地去做这件事，赢得了他们的喜爱。然后我们用大脑的另一部分来思考，如何实现规模化运作。在我结束这个话题之前，我会给你们举一个例子。现在在 Airbnb 上，如果你把房子挂在 Airbnb 上，你可以点击一个按钮，它的工作原理有点像优步。我们在优步之前就做了这个：专业摄影师会来到你家，免费为你的房屋拍照。我们在全球有 5000 名摄影师，已经拍摄了数十万套房屋。

So it's probably one of the largest on-demand photography networks, if there was such a thing, I guess probably the only one in the world. And that started with Joe and I. We were staying with this one host in New York City, and her house is amazing, but her photos were terrible. We said, why don't you just put up better photos? This was before iPhones had great cameras, this was 2008. She said, well, I can't figure out how to get photos from this camera onto this computer. She wasn't very technically savvy. We just said well, we'll just take photos for you. Or actually I said, what if you can press a button and somebody just showed up at your door and took professional photographs. She said, that would be magic. So next day, I knocked on her door and said I'm here. I photographed her home. Then we sent emails to people saying, we have this new magical photography service. If you want you can press this button and a professional photographer will show up at your home. Somewhere just press this button and just send me an alert or Joe an alert. We'd rent a camera in Brooklyn. In January of 2009 walking through snow, photographing people's homes. We did this by hand without any technology. We managed it with just spreadsheets. I wasn't gonna burden Nate with trying to build something we designed before we had photography. Then we started hiring contract photographers.

这可能是最大的按需摄影网络之一，如果真有这种东西存在的话，我猜可能是世界上唯一的。这一切始于乔和我。我们当时住在纽约市的一位房东家里，她的房子很棒，但照片拍得很糟糕。我们说，为什么不放些更好的照片呢？那时 iPhone 还没有很好的摄像头，那是 2008 年。她说，我不知道怎么把相机里的照片传到电脑上。她不太懂技术。我们就说，那我们帮你拍照吧。实际上我说，如果你能按下一个按钮，就有人出现在你家门口拍摄专业照片会怎样？她说，那就像魔法一样。于是第二天，我敲了她的门说"我来了"。我为她的家拍了照。然后我们给人们发邮件说，我们提供这种神奇的摄影服务。如果你愿意，可以按下这个按钮，专业摄影师就会出现在你家。只要按下这个按钮，给我或乔发个提醒就行。我们会在布鲁克林租相机。2009 年 1 月，我们冒着大雪穿行，为人们的家拍照。我们完全手工操作，没有任何技术支持，只用电子表格来管理。我不想给内特增加负担，让他在我们开展摄影业务前就构建我们设计的东西。然后我们开始雇佣合同摄影师。

Eventually we got an intern to manage all the contract photographers. Then we got an intern to become a full-time employee managing other interns to manage the contract employees. At some point, this is before we built anything, there were too many people to manage. There were like hundreds of photographers. Then we finally built all of the tools to manage all the photography, but we did it only after we knew exactly what the perfect service was.

最终我们找了一位实习生来管理所有合同摄影师。然后我们让一位实习生转为全职员工，管理其他实习生来管理合同员工。在我们开发任何工具之前，某个时间点出现了太多需要管理的人员。当时有数百名摄影师。直到我们完全了解理想的服务模式后，才最终开发出管理所有摄影工作的工具。

So the question is: in this particular situation with Airbnb, a lot of people think that this is not necessarily a technology company, but it's more of a marketing company. Good question. I'll answer the question with a story. Do you have proprietary technology? Yes. Do you have a moat? Yes. Do you have network effects? Yes. Do you have pricing power? Yes. Do you have a good brand? I think so.

问题是：在 Airbnb 这个特定案例中，很多人认为这不一定是家科技公司，而更像是家营销公司。好问题。我将通过一个故事来回答这个问题。你们有专有技术吗？有。你们有护城河吗？有。你们有网络效应吗？有。你们有定价权吗？有。你们有好的品牌吗？我想是的。

How about one more question? Are you a monopoly? I'm not gonna answer that. But I think similar to the question just forgetting about all of that. Companies that have network effects and sort of get off the ground based on the fly wheel is going. People just think that you're lucky. It's a totally fair question and people have said it, so I wanna answer it. The guy that runs the Sequoia Capital now, his name is Doug Leoni. One day, I think it was a year, year and a half ago, Doug Leoni says your job sucks. And I was like, what the hell does that mean? This is like you've got the worst job of a CEO in my portfolio. And I said tell me why, and this is what he said. He says well, let me, here's how I think about it. First of all, you're a technology company. And he thought we were a technology company and I would say, at our heart, in many ways we are a technology company. And so we have all the challenges of all my other portfolio companies. But beyond that, you are in 190 countries and so you have to figure out how to be international. We have to hire people in countries all over the world. We're literally in every country but North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Cuba. You're basically a payments company. We handle billions of dollars through our system every year and we had to get money transmitter licenses in the state of California. So we actually are a

再来一个问题怎么样？你是垄断企业吗？我不打算回答这个问题。但我认为类似于刚才那个问题，抛开所有这些不谈。具有网络效应并基于飞轮效应起步的公司正在发展。人们只是觉得你很幸运。这是个完全公平的问题，而且有人提过，所以我想回答。现在掌管红杉资本的人叫道格·利昂。有一天，大概一年或一年半前，道格·利昂说你的工作很糟糕。我当时想，这到底是什么意思？这就像你是我投资组合中 CEO 里工作最差劲的。我说告诉我原因，他是这么说的。他说，让我这样来思考这个问题。首先，你是一家科技公司。他认为我们是一家科技公司，而我想说，从本质上讲，我们在很多方面确实是一家科技公司。所以我们面临着我其他投资组合公司的所有挑战。但除此之外，你们进入了 190 个国家，所以你们必须考虑如何国际化。我们必须在世界各地招聘员工。我们几乎进入了所有国家，除了朝鲜、伊朗、叙利亚和古巴。你们基本上是一家支付公司。我们每年通过系统处理数十亿美元的资金，而且我们必须在加利福尼亚州获得货币转移许可证。所以我们实际上是一家

So we actually are a payments company, and we have serious fraud and risk to warrant, and needs to be locked down like Fort Knox. He said, that's usually where companies end. But you've gotta worry about all the other crap. And he says, trust in safety. You know we have 425,000 people staying in other people's beds, in their sheets. Think about a woman from Texas staying in the Middle East or vice versa. The cultural conflicts that could happen and misunderstandings and, you know, you have 425,000 people a night. It's like being the mayor of Oakland. Now, imagine if you're the mayor of Oakland, all these things happen in Oakland tonight. So you've got trust in safety. Now, we have regulatory problems. You know, we are in 34,000 cities. Every city has a different law, different rules. And many of them were written in a different century, before you had any of this technology. So you've got to deal with that. Then you've got issues like search and discovery. So, Google's got this brand about being really important about search. The thing about search, though, is usually if I have a question, if Google can give me 40,000 results, but it's probably clear that there's like one or two best options for everybody. So if I wanna know a question to an answer, these are usually my best answer. We have 40,000 homes in Paris. There is no best home in Paris for anybody in this room. So we have to be really, really great at matching.

我们实际上是一家支付公司，我们有严重的欺诈和风险需要防范，需要像诺克斯堡一样严密保护。他说，这通常是公司的终点。但你还得担心所有其他的麻烦事。他说，信任和安全。你知道我们有 425,000 人住在别人的床上，用他们的床单。想想一个来自德克萨斯的女性住在中东，或者反过来。可能发生的文化冲突和误解，你知道，你每晚有 425,000 人。这就像当奥克兰市长一样。现在，想象一下如果你是奥克兰市长，所有这些事情今晚都发生在奥克兰。所以你必须有信任和安全。现在，我们有监管问题。你知道，我们在 34,000 个城市运营。每个城市都有不同的法律，不同的规则。其中许多规则是在不同世纪制定的，在你们拥有任何这些技术之前。所以你必须处理这个问题。然后你还有搜索和发现这样的问题。谷歌这个品牌在搜索方面非常重要。但关于搜索的问题是，通常如果我有一个问题，如果谷歌能给我 40,000 个结果，但很可能对每个人来说只有一两个最佳选择。所以如果我想知道问题的答案，这些通常是我的最佳答案。我们在巴黎有 40,000 个房源。对这个房间里的任何人来说，巴黎都没有最佳房源。所以我们必须非常非常擅长匹配。

So we have to be really, really great at matching people and technology. We have to be a company that's just another example. Facebook, for example, is a digital product. Their product is their website. Our product are these experiences you have in the real world. So, we're not just an online product. We have to be an offline product. And we need to transition from when you're in your app, through cities. So basically, the long and short of it is we have to be world class at technology. We have to be world class at design. We have to be world class at branding, because we've got to convince people this isn't crazy. You're not gonna die when you use it. We had to convince governments this is good for neighborhood. What happens if the internet moves into your neighborhood? That's what people call it. It's a good thing, hopefully. And you've got to make sure trust in safety is really world class, that we handle all these payments and not have problems with risk. I think great companies are companies that are probably really strong at everything. But you know, we try to hire the very best engineers and technical talent in the world and I definitely don't see us as a marketing company.

我们必须非常擅长将人与技术相匹配。我们必须成为另一个典范公司。例如，Facebook 是一个数字产品。他们的产品是他们的网站。我们的产品是你在现实世界中的这些体验。因此，我们不仅仅是一个在线产品。我们必须成为一个离线产品。我们需要实现从你在应用程序中到穿越城市的过渡。基本上，总而言之，我们必须在技术上达到世界级水平。我们必须在设计上达到世界级水平。我们必须在品牌建设上达到世界级水平，因为我们必须让人们相信这不是疯狂的想法。使用它时你不会丧命。我们必须说服政府这对社区有益。如果互联网进入你的社区会发生什么？人们就是这样称呼它的。希望这是一件好事。你必须确保安全信任真正达到世界级水平，我们处理所有这些支付并且没有风险问题。我认为伟大的公司可能是在所有方面都非常强大的公司。但你知道，我们努力聘请世界上最好的工程师和技术人才，我绝对不认为我们是一家营销公司。

And these are just some of the examples why technology and design are important.

这些只是说明技术和设计重要性的部分示例。
