I want to start with a question for Mark and Ron, which is by far the number one question: What made you guys decide to invest in a founder or a company? Either of you. We have a slide on that. We have an app for that. Mark can start while we try to get your slide up. We're running out of AV guys, so say the question again. What makes you decide to invest in a founder or a company? So what makes us invest in a company is based on a whole bunch of characteristics. I've been doing this since 1994, right before Mark got out of the University of Illinois. So, SV Angel and its entities have invested in over 700 companies. To invest in 700 companies that means we've physically talked to thousands of entrepreneurs. There's a whole bunch of things that just go through my head when I meet an entrepreneur. I'm just going to talk about what some of those are. Literally while you're talking to me in the first minute I'm saying, is this person a leader? Is this person rifled, focused and obsessed by the product? Usually the first question I ask is what inspired you to invent this product. I'm hoping that it's based on a personal problem that founder had and this product is the solution to that personal problem. Then I'm looking for communication skills. Because if you're gonna be a leader and hire a team, assuming your product is successful you've gotta be.

我想先向马克和罗恩提一个问题，这是目前最重要的问题：是什么让你们决定投资一位创始人或一家公司？你们两位都可以回答。我们有一张相关的幻灯片。我们有一个专门处理这个的应用。在我们准备调出你的幻灯片时，马克可以先开始。我们的音视频技术人员不够用了，所以请再说一遍问题。是什么让你决定投资一位创始人或一家公司？我们投资一家公司是基于一系列特征。我从1994年就开始做这个，就在马克从伊利诺伊大学毕业之前。SV Angel及其关联实体已经投资了超过700家公司。投资700家公司意味着我们实际与数千名创业者交谈过。当我遇到一位创业者时，脑海中会闪过许多考量。我将谈谈其中一些因素。实际上，在你与我交谈的第一分钟里，我就在想：这个人是个领导者吗？这个人是否专注、聚焦并对产品充满热情？通常我第一个问题是：是什么启发你发明这个产品？我希望这是基于那位创始人遇到的个人问题，而这个产品正是解决那个个人问题的方案。然后我会考察沟通能力。因为如果你要成为领导者并组建团队，假设你的产品成功，你必须

Because if you're going to be a leader and hire a team, assuming your product is successful, you've got to be a really good communicator and you have to be a born leader. Now some of that you might have to learn those traits of leadership, but you better take charge and be able to be a leader.

因为如果你要成为领导者并组建团队，假设你的产品成功，你必须成为非常优秀的沟通者，并且必须天生具备领导才能。虽然其中一些领导特质可能需要学习，但你最好能够承担责任并成为领导者。

I'll switch back to slide hundred or your not. And so the big thing that you're looking for, no matter which sort of particular kind of criteria we talk about, they all have the characteristic of you're looking for the extreme outlier. The other thing I'd highlight that we think about a lot internally is we have this concept: invest in strength versus lack of weakness. And at first that sounds obvious, but it's actually fairly subtle. Which is sort of the default way to do venture capital is to kinda check boxes, right? So you know, really good founder, really good idea, really good products, really good initial customers, check check check check. Okay, if this is reasonable, I'll put money in it. What you find with those sorta checkbox deals is they get done all the time. What you find is they don't have something that really makes them really remarkable and special, right? They don't have an extreme strength that makes them an outlier. On the other side of that, the companies that have the really extreme strengths often have serious flaws. And so one of the cautionary lessons of venture capital is, if you don't invest on the basis of serious flaws, you don't invest in most of the big winners. And we can go through example after example after example of that, but that would have ruled out almost all the big winners over time. And so, at least what we aspire to do is to invest in the startups that have a really, really extreme strength along an important dimension.

我要切换回第100张幻灯片。无论我们讨论哪种具体标准，你寻找的核心要素都具有一个共同特征：你在寻找极端的异常值。我重点强调的另一个我们内部经常思考的概念是：投资于优势而非没有弱点。这初听起来显而易见，但实际上相当微妙。风险投资的默认方式有点像打勾确认，对吧？比如优秀创始人、优秀创意、优秀产品、优秀初始客户，一个个打勾确认。如果这些都合理，我就会投资。你会发现这类打勾式的交易经常发生，但它们缺乏真正使其卓越和特别的要素。它们没有那种使其成为异常值的极端优势。另一方面，拥有真正极端优势的公司往往存在严重缺陷。风险投资的一个警示教训是，如果你因为严重缺陷而不投资，你就会错过大多数大赢家。我们可以举出一个又一个这样的例子，但这样做会排除掉历史上几乎所有的大赢家。因此，我们至少渴望做的是投资那些在重要维度上具有真正极端优势的初创公司。

And they'd be willing to tolerate some other set of weaknesses. Ron, we got your slide up. Okay, I don't want to over dwell on the slide. But when you first meet an investor, you've got to be able to say in one compelling sentence that you should practice like crazy what your product does, so that the investor that you're talking to immediately can picture the product in their own mind. Probably 25% of the entrepreneurs I talk to today still after the first sentence, I don't know what they do. And as I get older and less patient, I say back up, I don't even know what you do yet. But so try and get that perfect. And then I wanna skip to the second column. You have to be decisive. The only way to make progress is make decisions. Procrastination is the devil in startups. So no matter what you do, you gotta keep that ship moving. If it's decisions to hire, decisions to fire, you've gotta make those quickly. All about building a great team. Once you have a great product, then it's all about execution and building a great team. Parker, could you talk about your seed ground and how that went, and what you wish you had done differently as a foundry, raising money? Sure, so actually I think that my seed ground most of the stuff with my current company felt like, from a fundraising perspective felt like it came together relatively quickly. But actually one of the experiences I had, I started a company before this, that I was at for about six years and my cofounder and I pitched almost every VC firm in Silicon Valley.

他们愿意容忍其他一些弱点。罗恩，你的幻灯片已经准备好了。好的，我不想在幻灯片上过多停留。但当你第一次见到投资者时，你必须能够用一句引人入胜的话来阐述你的产品功能，这句话你需要疯狂练习，这样与你交谈的投资者就能立即在脑海中构想出产品形象。如今我交谈过的创业者中，大概有25%的人在说完第一句话后，我仍然不知道他们是做什么的。随着我年纪增长、耐心减少，我会说：等一下，我甚至还不清楚你们是做什么的。所以要努力把这句话练到完美。然后我想跳到第二点。你必须果断决策。取得进展的唯一方法就是做出决定。拖延是创业公司的大敌。所以无论你做什么，都必须让这艘船持续前进。无论是招聘决策还是解雇决策，你都必须快速做出。这一切都关乎于打造一个优秀的团队。一旦你有了出色的产品，接下来就是执行和组建优秀团队。帕克，你能谈谈你的种子轮融资情况吗？进展如何？作为创始人，在融资方面你希望当时有哪些不同的做法？当然，实际上我认为我当前公司的种子轮融资从筹资角度来看，感觉相对较快地就完成了。但实际上我经历过的一件事是，在此之前我创办过一家公司，在那里待了大约六年，我和我的联合创始人几乎向硅谷所有的风投公司都做过推介。

You can't count on there being capital available to you. And so this business that I started seemed like one that I could do without raising money at all. There might be a path where there was enough cash flow, it seemed compelling enough that I could do that. And it turns out that those are exactly the kinds of businesses that investors love to invest in, and it made it incredibly easy. So I actually think, I mean, Sam's very kind and said I was an expert fundraiser. The reality is I don't actually even think I'm very good at fundraising. It's probably something I'm less good at than other parts of my job. But I think if you can build a business where everything's moving in the right direction, if you can be like the Twitter guys, nothing else matters. And if you can't be like the Twitter guys, it's very hard for anything else to make a difference for things to come together for you.

你不能指望有现成的资金等着你。因此，我创办的这个企业看起来像是那种完全不需要融资就能做起来的项目。可能存在这样一条路径：有足够的现金流，看起来足够有吸引力，让我能够实现这个目标。事实证明，这些恰恰是投资者最愿意投资的企业类型，这让融资变得异常容易。实际上我认为，Sam人很好，说我是融资专家。但现实是，我甚至不认为自己很擅长融资。这可能是我工作中相对其他方面不太擅长的领域。但我认为，如果你能建立一个所有方面都朝着正确方向发展的企业，如果你能像Twitter团队那样，其他一切都不重要。而如果你不能像Twitter团队那样，其他任何因素都很难帮助你实现突破。

Why did that VC say be like the Twitter guys when the fail wail dominated the site for two years? The best thing you'll ever hear, which is also what I was going to say, is the number one piece of advice that I've ever read and that I tell people on these kinds of topics. It's from the comedian Steve Martin, who I think is an absolute genius. He wrote a great book on his startup career which obviously was very successful. The book is called Born Standing Up, and it's literally a short little book that describes how he became Steve Martin. In the book, he says what is the key to success. He says the key to success is be so good they can't ignore you. So in a sense, we're gonna have this entire conversation about how to raise money, but in a sense it's all kind of beside the point. Because if you do what Parker's done and you build a business that is going to be a gigantic success, then investors are throwing money at you. And if you come in with a theory and a plan and no data, you're just one of the next thousand. It's gonna be far, far harder to raise money. So that's the positive way to put it: be so good they can't ignore you. In other words, you're almost always better off making your business better than you are making your pitch better. The other thing, that's the positive way of looking at it. The negative way of looking at it, or the cautionary lesson, is that this gets me in trouble every single time I say it.

为什么那位风险投资人说要像Twitter团队那样，尽管失败之声在网站上占据了两年之久？你将会听到的最好的建议，也是我正要说的，是我读过并在这类话题上告诉人们的第一条建议。它来自喜剧演员史蒂夫·马丁，我认为他是个绝对的天才。他写了一本关于自己创业生涯的精彩书籍，显然非常成功。这本书名为《天生站立》，它确实是一本简短的小书，描述了他如何成为史蒂夫·马丁。在书中，他谈到什么是成功的关键。他说成功的关键是变得如此优秀，以至于别人无法忽视你。所以在某种意义上，我们将会进行这场关于如何融资的完整对话，但在某种意义上，这一切都有些偏离重点。因为如果你像帕克那样做，建立一个将会取得巨大成功的企业，那么投资者就会争相给你投钱。而如果你带着理论和计划而来，却没有数据，你只是接下来数千人中的一个。融资将会变得极其困难。所以这是积极的表述方式：变得如此优秀，以至于别人无法忽视你。换句话说，你几乎总是应该把精力放在改善业务上，而不是完善你的推销演讲上。另一方面，这是看待问题的积极方式。看待问题的消极方式，或者说警示教训，就是每次我说这个都会惹上麻烦。

but I'm on a ton of flu medications so I'm going to go ahead and just let it rip.
我吃了很多感冒药，所以打算不管不顾地畅所欲言。

Raising venture capital is the easiest thing a startup founder is ever going to do.
筹集风险投资是初创企业创始人将要做的最简单的事情。

As compared to recruiting, right? As compared to recruiting engineers.
相比招聘来说，对吧？相比招聘工程师来说。

In particular as compared to recruiting engineer number 20.
特别是相比招聘第20号工程师来说。

It's far harder than raising venture capital.
这比筹集风险投资要困难得多。

Selling to enterprise customers is harder.
向企业客户销售更难。

Getting viral growth going on a consumer business is harder, getting advertising revenue is harder, almost everything you'll ever do is harder than raising venture capital.
在消费者业务上实现病毒式增长更难，获得广告收入更难，你将要做的几乎所有事情都比筹集风险投资更难。

And so, I think Parker is exactly right.
所以，我认为帕克完全正确。

If you get in a situation in which raising the money is hard, it's probably not hard compared to all the other stuff that's about to follow.
如果你遇到筹款困难的情况，与接下来所有其他事情相比，这可能并不算困难。

And it's very important to bear that in mind.
牢记这一点非常重要。

You know, it's often said that raising money is not actually a success, it's not actually a milestone for a company and I think that's true and I think that's the underlying reason.
你知道，人们常说筹款实际上并不是成功，实际上不是公司的里程碑，我认为这是对的，我认为这是根本原因。

It just puts you in a position to be able to do all the other, harder things.
它只是让你能够去做所有其他更困难的事情。

Related to that, what do you guys wish founders did differently when raising the money?
与此相关，你们希望创始人在筹款时有什么不同的做法？

You mentioned this relationship between money and how that applies here, so maybe we could start with that.
你提到了金钱与这里如何应用之间的关系，所以也许我们可以从这里开始。

Yeah, so the single biggest thing that people are just missing, and I think it's all of our faults.
是的，人们最缺失的一点，我认为这都是我们的错。

We're all not talking about it enough, but I think the single biggest thing entrepreneurs are missing both on fundraising and how they run their companies is the relationship between risk and cash.
我们都没有充分讨论这个问题，但我认为企业家在筹款和公司运营方面最缺失的是风险与现金之间的关系。

I'm on a ton of flu medications, so I'm going to go ahead. So the relationship between risk and raising cash, and then the relationship with risk and spending cash. I've always been a fan of something that Andy Radcliffe taught me years ago, which he called the Onion Theory of Risk. Basically, you can think about a startup on day one as having every conceivable kind of risk, right? You can basically just make a list of the risks. So you've got founding team risk: are the founders going to be able to work together? Do you have the right founders? You're going to have product risk: can you build a product? You'll have technical risk, which is maybe you need a machine learning breakthrough or something to make it work. How are you going to be able to do that? You'll have launch risk: will the launch go well? You'll have market acceptance risk. You'll have revenue risk. A big risk you get into in a lot of businesses that have a sales force is can you actually sell the product for enough money to actually pay for the cost of sale. So you have cost of sale risk. If your consumer product, you'll have viral growth risk. Well, you get the thinner viral growth. I'll start up at the very beginning. It's basically just this long list of risks. Then, the way I always think about running a startup is also the way I think about raising money, which is a process of peeling away layers of risk as you go. You raise seed money in order to peel away the first two or three risks.

我服用了很多感冒药，所以我要继续讲下去。关于风险与筹集资金的关系，以及风险与支出资金的关系。我一直很喜欢安迪·拉德克利夫多年前教我的一个理论，他称之为"风险洋葱理论"。基本上，你可以把创业公司第一天面临的情况想象成拥有所有可能想到的风险，对吧？你基本上可以列出一个风险清单。比如创始团队风险：创始人们能否一起合作？你是否拥有合适的创始人？产品风险：你能否开发出产品？技术风险：也许你需要机器学习方面的突破或其他技术来实现产品功能。你打算如何做到这一点？发布风险：产品发布能否顺利进行？市场接受度风险。收入风险。在很多拥有销售团队的企业中，一个重大风险是你能否以足够高的价格销售产品来支付销售成本。所以你有销售成本风险。如果是消费类产品，你会有病毒式增长风险。你会获得较弱的病毒式增长。创业公司在最初阶段基本上就是这样一个长长的风险清单。然后，我一直认为经营初创公司的方式也是我考虑融资的方式，这是一个随着发展逐步剥离风险层的过程。你筹集种子资金是为了剥离最初的两三个风险。

The founding team risk, the product risk, maybe the initial watch risk. You raise the A round to peel away the next level of product risk. Maybe you peel away some recruiting risk, because you get your full engineering team built. And maybe you peel away some customer risk, because you get your first phi beta customers, right? And so, basically, the way to think about it is, you're peeling away risk as you go. You're peeling away risk by achieving milestones. And then, as you achieve milestones, you're both making progress in your business and you're justifying raising more capital, right? And so you come in and you pitch somebody like us. And you say you're raising your B round. The best way to do that with us is you say: I raised the seed round, I achieved these milestones, I eliminated these risks. I raised the A round, I achieved these milestones, I eliminated these risks. Now I'm gonna raise a B round. Here are milestones. Here are my risks. And then by the time I go to raise the seed round, here's the state that I'll be in. And then you calibrate the amount of money that you've raised to spend to the risks that you're pulling out of the business. I go through all this because it's a systematic way to think about how the money gets raised and deployed, as compared to so much of what's happening especially these days.

创始团队风险，产品风险，可能还有初期市场风险。你进行A轮融资是为了消除下一层级的产品风险。也许你消除了一些招聘风险，因为你建立了完整的工程团队。也许你消除了一些客户风险，因为你获得了首批测试客户，对吧？因此，基本的思考方式是，你在不断消除风险。你通过达成里程碑来消除风险。然后，当你达成里程碑时，你既在业务上取得进展，也在为筹集更多资金提供理由，对吧？所以你来找我们这样的投资方进行路演。你说你要进行B轮融资。最好的方式就是告诉我们：我完成了种子轮融资，达成了这些里程碑，消除了这些风险。我完成了A轮融资，达成了这些里程碑，消除了这些风险。现在我要进行B轮融资。这些是里程碑。这些是我的风险。等到我要进行种子轮融资时，这就是我将要达到的状态。然后你根据要从业务中消除的风险来校准筹集和使用的资金额度。我详细说明这一切，是因为这是一种系统性的思考方式，来理解资金如何筹集和部署，特别是与当下许多普遍做法形成对比。

Which is just oh my god let me go raise as much money as I can, let me go build the fancy offices, let me go hire as many people as I can and just kind of hope for the best. I'm gonna be tactical. For sure don't ask people to sign an NDA. We rarely get asked anymore because most founders have figured out that if you ask somebody for an NDA at the front end of the relationship, you're basically saying, I don't trust you. So the relationship between investors and founders involves lots of trust. The biggest mistake that I see by far is not getting things in writing. You know, my advice on the fund raising process is do it as quickly and as efficiently as you possibly can, don't obsess over it. For some reason, founders get their ego involved in fundraising, where it's a personal victory. It is the tiniest step on the way, as Mark said. And it's the most fundamental. Hurry up and get it over with. But in the process when somebody makes a commitment to you, you get in your car and you type an email to them that confirms what they just said to you. Because investors have, a lot of investors have very short memories and they forget that they committed to you that they were going to finance. Or they forget what the valuation was, or that they were going to find a co-investor. You can get rid of all that controversy just by putting it in writing, and when they try and get out of it you just resend the email and say, excuse me and hopefully they've replied to that email anyway. So get it in writing.

这就像是"天啊，让我去筹集尽可能多的资金，让我去建造豪华的办公室，让我去雇佣尽可能多的人"，然后只能听天由命。我会采取策略性行动。千万不要要求别人签署保密协议。现在很少有人要求这个了，因为大多数创始人都已经明白，如果在关系刚开始时就要求对方签署保密协议，基本上就是在说"我不信任你"。所以投资者和创始人之间的关系需要大量信任。到目前为止，我见过最大的错误就是没有把事情书面化。你知道，我对融资过程的建议是尽可能快速高效地完成，不要过分纠结于此。出于某种原因，创始人在融资过程中会掺杂个人自尊，将其视为个人胜利。正如马克所说，这只是前进道路上最微小的一步，但又是最基础的。抓紧时间完成它。但是在这个过程中，当有人对你做出承诺时，你应该坐进车里就给他们发一封邮件，确认他们刚才对你说的话。因为投资者，很多投资者的记性很差，他们会忘记自己承诺过要为你提供资金，或者忘记估值是多少，或者忘记他们要找共同投资者。通过书面记录，你可以避免所有这些争议，当他们试图反悔时，你只需重新发送那封邮件并说"不好意思"，而且希望他们已经回复了那封邮件。所以一定要把事情书面化。

In meetings, take notes and follow up on what's important. I want to talk a little bit more about tactics here. Just how does the process go? Can people email you guys directly? Do they need to get an introduction? How many meetings does it take for you to make a decision? How do you figure out what the right terms are? When can a founder ask you for a check? That was about it. That was like six questions. That's a lot of things. Yeah, okay, good. It's the process. Why don't you describe, because you'll describe seed then I'll describe. Yeah, yeah. So yeah. So, SV Angel invests in seed stage start-ups. We like to be the very first investor. We normally invest today at around one to two million. It used to only be a million. So if we invest 250k, that means there's five or six other investors in that syndicate. SV Angel now has a staff of 13 people. I do no due diligence anymore. I am not a picker anymore. I just help on major projects for the portfolio companies that are starting to mature. But we have a whole team that processes. We at SV Angel end up investing in one company for every 30 that we look at, and we end up investing in about one a week. I think what's interesting is we don't really take anything over the transom. Our network is so huge now that we basically just take leads from our own network. We evaluate the opportunity which means you have to

在会议中要做笔记，并跟进重要事项。我想在这里多谈一些策略。具体流程是怎样的？人们可以直接给你们发邮件吗？他们需要有人介绍吗？你们需要开多少次会才能做出决定？你们如何确定合适的条款？创始人什么时候可以向你们要支票？大概就是这样。这大概有六个问题。内容很多。是的，好的，很好。这就是流程。不如你来描述吧，因为你会描述种子轮，然后我来描述。是的，是的。所以，SV Angel投资于种子阶段的初创公司。我们喜欢成为第一个投资者。我们现在通常投资大约100万到200万美元。过去只有100万美元。所以如果我们投资25万美元，那就意味着该联合投资中有五到六个其他投资者。SV Angel现在有13名员工。我不再做尽职调查了。我不再是挑选者了。我只是帮助投资组合中开始成熟的公司处理重大项目。但我们有一个完整的处理团队。在SV Angel，我们每看30家公司最终会投资一家，我们每周大约投资一家。我认为有趣的是，我们实际上不接受任何主动提交的项目。我们的网络现在非常庞大，基本上只接受来自我们自己网络的线索。我们评估机会，这意味着你必须

We evaluate the opportunity which means you have to send in a really great short executive summary. And if we like that we actually vote, although I'm not in this meeting anymore, but the group actually votes on do we make a phone call. That's how important time is in this process. And if enough of the team at SV thinks it's interesting, then they appoint a person to make a phone call to that founder, usually somebody on our team who has domain experience. If the phone call goes well, bingo, we want to meet you. If SV Angel asks you for a meeting we are well on our way to investing. If that meeting goes well, we'll do some background checks. Backdoor background checks. Get a good feeling about the company. The market that they're going after. And then, and then make the commitment to invest. And then start, start helping get other value add investors to be part of the syndicate. Because if we're gonna have an equal workload we want the other investors in this company to be great angel investors as well.

我们评估机会意味着您需要提交一份非常出色的简短执行摘要。如果我们喜欢这份摘要，我们会进行投票，虽然我已不再参加这个会议，但团队会投票决定是否打电话联系。这就是时间在这个过程中如此重要的原因。如果SV团队中有足够多的人认为这很有趣，他们就会指定一个人给那位创始人打电话，通常是我们团队中具有相关领域经验的人。如果电话沟通顺利，太好了，我们想与您会面。如果SV Angel要求与您会面，我们就已经走在投资的道路上了。如果那次会面顺利，我们会进行一些背景调查。后门背景调查。对公司和它们要进入的市场获得良好感觉。然后，然后做出投资承诺。接着开始帮助其他增值投资者加入联合投资。因为如果我们要承担同等的工作量，我们希望这家公司的其他投资者也是优秀的天使投资人。

So I'll talk a little bit about the venture stage and the series A stage, the problems. To start with, I think it's fair to say that at this point all top tier venture capitalists pretty much only invest in two kinds of companies at the series A stage. One is if they have previously raised a seed round. It's almost always the case when we're doing a series A investment and the company has a million or two million in seed financing from Ron and folks that he likes to work with. Almost always, by the way, Ron just to be clear, and folks he likes to work with. So first, either they have a seed round. So if you're going to raise serious aid, the first thing to do is raise seed, because that's generally the way the progression works at this point. Every once in a while we'll go straight to a series A on a company that hasn't raised seed rounds. Really the only times that happens are when it's a founder who has been a successful founder in the past, and is almost certainly somebody we've worked with in the past. Actually we have an announcement we just made, one of these we'll announce in a few weeks. It's a founder who I was an angel investor for, actually I think Ryan was also in the team's company in 2006. Then the company did its thing and ultimately was acquired by another big company. Then that team now is starting their new thing. So in that case, we're just going to jump straight to a series A because they're so well-known and they have a plan all lined up for it. But that's the exception. It's almost always preceded by a seed round. The other thing is, I guess I mentioned this already, but we get similar to what Ron said, we get 2000 referrals a year through our referral network. A very large percentage of those are referrals through the seed investors. So by far the best way to get investor introductions to the series A stage investor firms is to be able to work through the seed investors or to work through something.

我将简要谈谈风险投资阶段和A轮融资阶段的问题。首先，我认为可以公平地说，目前所有顶级风险投资公司基本上只投资两种类型的公司进行A轮融资。一种是那些之前已经进行过种子轮融资的公司。当我们进行A轮投资时，几乎总是这种情况：公司已经从Ron以及他喜欢合作的伙伴那里获得了100万或200万美元的种子资金。顺便说清楚，几乎总是Ron和他喜欢合作的伙伴。所以首先，要么他们已经有了种子轮融资。因此，如果你想要获得重要的资金支持，第一件事就是进行种子轮融资，因为这通常是现阶段的发展路径。偶尔我们会直接对没有进行过种子轮融资的公司进行A轮投资。真正发生这种情况的唯一时机是当创始人过去曾是成功的创始人，而且几乎肯定是我们过去合作过的人。实际上我们刚刚有一个公告，几周后我们会宣布其中一个案例。这是一位我曾经作为天使投资人投资过的创始人，实际上我认为Ryan在2006年也参与了这家团队公司。然后公司发展壮大，最终被另一家大公司收购。现在那个团队正在开始他们的新项目。所以在这种情况下，我们会直接跳到A轮融资，因为他们非常知名，并且已经为此制定了完整的计划。但这是例外情况。几乎总是先有种子轮融资。另一件事是，我想我已经提到过这一点，但就像Ron说的那样，我们通过推荐网络每年收到2000个推荐。其中很大一部分是通过种子投资者推荐的。因此，到目前为止，获得A轮投资机构介绍的最佳方式是通过种子投资者或通过其他途径进行合作。

Speaking about terms, what terms should founders care most about? And how should founders negotiate? Maybe Parker, we'll start with you on this one. Sure. Well I think probably precisely because of what Mark said. The most important thing at the seed stage is picking the right seed investors, because they're gonna sort of lay the foundation for future fundraising events. You know, they're gonna make the right introductions. And I think there's an enormous difference in the quality of an introduction. So if you can get a really good introduction from someone who a venture capitalist really trusts and respects, you know, the likelihood that that's gonna go well is so much higher than sort of like a much more lukewarm introduction from someone they don't know as well. So the seed stage, probably the best thing you can do is find the right investors.

说到条款，创始人最应该关心哪些条款？创始人应该如何进行谈判？也许帕克，我们从你开始回答这个问题。当然。我认为很可能正是因为马克所说的。在种子阶段最重要的事情是选择合适的种子投资者，因为他们将为未来的融资活动奠定基础。他们会提供合适的引荐。我认为引荐的质量存在巨大差异。如果你能从风险投资人真正信任和尊重的人那里获得很好的引荐，那么进展顺利的可能性要比从他们不太熟悉的人那里获得冷淡的引荐高得多。所以在种子阶段，你能做的最好的事情可能就是找到合适的投资者。

Or to work through something like thought were seemed okay, but were not highly rated by YC. That ended up being the case that they were real duds in the seed round. Someday we're gonna publish our list of these people. Oh my god there are going to be a lot of upset people when you do. So, how do you think about negotiation? How do you figure out what the right evaluation for a company is and what are the terms? Well so I started out. When I was raising my seed round I really didn't know. We had conversations about this. I probably started a little too high on the valuation side. As you guys know, Y company sort of culminates in this thing called demo day, where you can get all of these investors at once, who are looking at the company. I started out trying to raise money at like a $12 or $15 million dollar valuation. Everyone was like, that's crazy. That's completely nuts. You're too big for your britches, that's completely just wouldn't work. I ended up walking it down a little bit and within the space of a couple days said okay, well I'm gonna raise at nine. Suddenly, for whatever reason that had hit some magical threshold on the seed stage, that it was below 10.

或者处理一些看似不错但实际上并不被YC看好的想法。最终事实证明他们在种子轮中确实是失败者。总有一天我们会公布这些人的名单。天啊，当你这么做的时候会有很多人不高兴的。那么，你是如何看待谈判的？你如何确定一家公司的正确估值以及条款是什么？嗯，我是这样开始的。当我进行种子轮融资时，我真的不知道。我们对此进行了讨论。我可能在估值方面起点有点太高了。正如你们所知，Y公司的最终阶段是所谓的演示日，在那里你可以一次性接触到所有关注这家公司的投资者。我最初试图以1200万或1500万美元的估值筹集资金。所有人都说，这太疯狂了。这完全疯了。你太自不量力了，这完全行不通。最终我稍微降低了估值，在几天内说好吧，我打算以900万估值融资。突然之间，不知为何这达到了种子阶段的某个神奇门槛，即低于1000万。

It seemed like there was almost infinite demand for the round at a $9 million cap. So no-one would pay 12, but at a $9 million cap it felt like I probably could have raised ten million dollars. The round came together in roughly about a week. At that point, once I kind of hit that threshold, there seemed to be these sort of thresholds, particularly for seed-stage companies, that investors will think of as crazy above this level. There's sort of like a rough range that people are willing to pay. You just have to figure out what that is, get the money that you need, don't raise any more than you need, and just get it done. At the end of the day, whether you raise 12 or nine or six, it's not a huge deal for the rest of the company.

看起来这轮融资在900万美元上限时几乎有无限需求。所以没人愿意支付1200万，但在900万美元上限时，我感觉自己可能能够筹集到1000万美元。这轮融资大约在一周内完成。当我达到那个门槛时，似乎存在这样的门槛，特别是对于种子阶段的公司，投资者会认为超过这个水平是疯狂的。人们愿意支付的价格有一个大致范围。你只需要弄清楚这个范围，获得你需要的资金，不要筹集超过你需要的金额，然后完成融资。归根结底，无论你筹集1200万、900万还是600万，对公司其他方面来说都不是什么大问题。

Between 20 and 30% of the company, venture capitalists tend to be a lot more ownership-focused than price-focused. Sometimes when companies raise really big rounds, it's because the investor basically said they're not going to go below 20% ownership but will pay more for it. Above 30%, probably sort of weird things happen to the cap table. It gets hard down the line to have enough room on the cap table for everyone. Everything seems to come in at that range, so that probably just is what it is in most cases.

At the seed stage, there doesn't seem to be any magic to it, but it seems like ten to 15% is what people say. That's mostly just what I've heard. I'm curious about your guys' thoughts.

公司股权的20%到30%之间，风险投资者往往更关注所有权而非价格。有时当公司进行大规模融资时，是因为投资者基本上表示他们不会接受低于20%的所有权，但愿意为此支付更高价格。超过30%时，股权结构表可能会出现一些奇怪的情况。后续很难在股权结构表上为所有人留出足够空间。一切似乎都在这个范围内，所以在大多数情况下可能就是这样。

在种子阶段，似乎没有什么神奇之处，但10%到15%似乎是人们常说的比例。这主要只是我听到的情况。我想知道你们的想法。

Because if you keep giving away more than that, there's not enough left for you and the team, and you're the ones doing all the work. Thank you. Well actually, we've seen a series of interesting companies in the last five years where we simply won't bid. Sometimes the basis of the cap table's already destroyed. Outside investors already own too much. There's a company we really wanted to invest in but the outside investors already owned 80% of it when we talked to them. And it was still a relatively young company. They had just done two early rounds that had just sold too much of the company. And literally we were worried, and I think accurately so, that it was gonna be demotivating for that team to have that structure. One more question for you before we open up to the audience, for Ron and Clark. Could you guys both tell the story of the most successful investment you ever made and how that came to happen? Other than Zenefits of course. Yeah, other than Zenefits. Yeah other than Zenefits. That's gonna be hard. For me clearly it was the investment in Google in 1999. And we got Google return out of it. But funny enough I met Google through a Stanford professor David Cheriton, who was in the school of engineering. He's still here. He was actually an angel investor in Google and an investor in our fund.

因为如果你不断放弃超过这个比例的股权，留给你和团队的份额就不够了，而你们才是完成所有工作的人。谢谢。实际上，过去五年我们看到了一系列有趣的公司，我们就是不会出价投资。有时候股权结构表的基础已经被破坏。外部投资者已经拥有太多股份。有一家公司我们真的很想投资，但当我们与他们交谈时，外部投资者已经拥有80%的股份。而那仍然是一家相对年轻的公司。他们刚刚完成两轮早期融资，却已经出售了公司太多股份。说实话我们很担心，而且我认为这种担心是准确的，这样的股权结构会让那个团队失去动力。在向观众开放提问之前，还有一个问题要问Ron和Clark。你们能分别讲述自己做过的最成功的投资案例及其发生过程吗？当然除了Zenefits之外。是的，除了Zenefits。除了Zenefits。这可能会很难。对我来说，显然是1999年对谷歌的投资。我们从中获得了谷歌的回报。但有趣的是，我是通过斯坦福大学教授David Cheriton认识谷歌的，他是工程学院的教授。他现在还在这里。他实际上是谷歌的天使投资人，也是我们基金的投资者。

The quid pro quo we have with our investors in the fund is that you have to tell us about any interesting companies that you see. We loved it when Jared became an investor in our fund because he had access to the computer science department's deal flow. We were at this party at DFA's house in full tuxedo. I hate tuxedos. Does anyone here know David Sheraton? You know for sure he does not like tuxedos, and he was in a tuxedo. I went up to him and we complained about our attire, and then I said, "Hey, what's happening at Stanford?" He said, "Well, there's this project called Backrub. It's search by page rank and relevancy." Today, everyone says page rank and relevancy are obvious, but in 1998, it was not obvious that engineers were designing a product based on this thing called page rank. It was a simple algorithm that said if a lot of people go to that website and other websites direct them there, there must be something good happening on that website. That was the original algorithm, and the motivation was relevance. I said to David, "I have to meet these people." He said, "You can't meet them until they're ready," which was the following May, funny enough. I waited and called them every month for five months. Finally, I got my audition with Larry and Sergei. Right away, they were very strategic. They said, "We'll let you invest if you can get Sequoia. We don't know Sequoia, but they're investors in Yahoo!"

我们与基金投资者之间的互惠条件是，你必须告诉我们你看到的任何有趣公司。当贾里德成为我们基金的投资者时，我们非常高兴，因为他能够接触到计算机科学系的交易流。我们在DFA家参加派对，穿着全套晚礼服。我讨厌晚礼服。在座有人认识大卫·谢拉顿吗？你们肯定知道他不喜欢晚礼服，但他当时却穿着晚礼服。我走到他面前，我们一起抱怨了穿着，然后我说："嘿，斯坦福有什么新鲜事吗？"他说："嗯，有个叫Backrub的项目。它是通过网页排名和相关性进行搜索的。"如今大家都说网页排名和相关性显而易见，但在1998年，工程师基于这个叫做网页排名的概念来设计产品并不明显。那是个简单的算法，意思是如果很多人访问某个网站，并且其他网站都指向它，那么这个网站一定有什么好东西。这就是最初的算法，其动机就是相关性。我对大卫说："我必须见见这些人。"他说："在他们准备好之前你不能见他们"，有趣的是那要到第二年五月。我等待了五个月，每个月都给他们打电话。最终我获得了与拉里和谢尔盖的会面机会。他们立刻展现出很强的策略性。他们说："如果你能请来红杉资本，我们就让你投资。我们不认识红杉资本，但他们是雅虎的投资者。"

And because we're late to market we want to know we have a deal with Yahoo! And so I earned my way into the investment in Google. How about you?

因为我们进入市场较晚，我们想确保与雅虎达成协议。就这样我成功获得了投资谷歌的机会。你呢？

I was talking about the other side which is Airbnb, which we actually were not early investors in. We did Airbnb as a growth round. We did the first big growth round at Airbnb at about a billion dollar valuation in 2011. I believe that will turn out to be one of the spectacular growth investments of all time. But I think it's gonna be one of the big companies.

我谈论的是另一家公司，就是爱彼迎，我们实际上并不是它的早期投资者。我们是在增长轮次投资爱彼迎的。我们在2011年以约10亿美元的估值参与了爱彼迎的首个大型增长轮融资。我相信这最终将成为有史以来最出色的增长投资之一。但我认为它将成为大型企业之一。

So I tell that story because it's not a story of pure genius. We passed, we didn't even meet with them, I don't think we met with them the first time around, or maybe one of our junior people did. I said earlier that venture capital is entirely a game of outliers. One of the key things with outliers is the ideas often seem completely nuts up front. Of course, the idea of a website where you can have other people stay in your house, if you just made a list of the ideas that are most nuts, that would be right there at the top.

我讲述这个故事是因为它并非纯粹天才的故事。我们错过了，我们甚至没有与他们见面，我认为我们第一次没有与他们见面，也许是我们的一位初级员工见过。我之前说过，风险投资完全是一场关于异常值的游戏。异常值的关键特征之一是这些想法最初往往显得完全荒谬。当然，一个让人们可以住在别人家里的网站，如果你列出最疯狂的想法清单，这个想法肯定会名列前茅。

and because we're late to market we want to uniquely combine both of those bad ideas. So, of course, it turns out they've unlocked an entirely new way to basically sell real estate. They've unlocked this gigantic global phenomenon. It's gonna be an enormously successful company. So part was just coming to grips with the fact that we had whiffed on our initial analysis of the idea, and that the numbers were clearly proving that we were wrong, and the customer behavior was clearly proving that we were wrong. So one of our philosophies at our firm is that we're multistage. A big reason for that is so we can fix our mistakes and we can pay up to get in later when we screw up early on. The other thing I'll highlight though is the other reason why we pulled the trigger at a high evaluation when we did was because we had spent time at that point with the founders, with Brian and with Joe and Nate. And there's a friend of mine in private equity who has this great line, Egon Durban has this great line. He says when people progress through their careers, they get bigger and bigger jobs, and at some point they get the really big job. And it's, some people grow into the big job, and about the other half of people swell into it, right? And you can kinda tell the difference. There's a point where people just lose their minds. And one of the issues with these companies that are sort of super successful hyper growth companies is, you know, this would be the sorta the classic case. These super young founders who haven't run anything before,

由于我们进入市场较晚，我们想要独特地结合这两个糟糕的想法。当然，结果证明他们开创了一种全新的房地产销售方式。他们解锁了这个巨大的全球现象。这将是一家极其成功的公司。所以我们部分是在接受这样一个事实：我们最初对这个想法的分析出现了失误，数据清楚地证明我们错了，客户行为也清楚地证明我们错了。我们公司的一个理念就是我们是多阶段的。这样做的一个重要原因是我们可以纠正错误，在早期搞砸后可以付出更高代价后期进入。不过我要强调的另一点是，我们之所以在高估值时果断出手，是因为我们当时与创始人布莱恩、乔和内特共度了时光。我在私募股权领域的一位朋友有句名言，埃贡·杜尔班有句名言。他说当人们在职业生涯中不断进步时，他们会得到越来越重要的工作，在某个时点他们会得到真正重要的职位。有些人会逐渐适应重要职位，而另外约一半的人则会膨胀地适应，对吧？你大致能看出区别。有个临界点人们会完全失去理智。这些超级成功的超高速增长公司面临的问题之一就是，这算是典型情况。这些超级年轻的创始人之前从未管理过任何事物，

These super young founders who haven't run anything before, so how are they gonna be at running this sort of giant global operation? We just were tremendously impressed, and today, every time we deal with all three of those guys, how mature they are, how much they are progressing. You know, it's like they get more and more mature, they get better and better adjustment, and they get more and more humble as they grow. And so that made us feel really good. That not just was this business gonna grow, but that these were guys who were gonna be able to build something and be able to run it in a really good way.

这些超级年轻的创始人之前从未管理过任何事物，他们如何能够运营这种庞大的全球业务？我们对此印象极为深刻，而如今，每次与这三位创始人打交道时，都能感受到他们的成熟度以及他们的进步程度。你知道，他们似乎变得越来越成熟，调整能力越来越强，随着成长也变得越来越谦逊。这让我们感到非常欣慰。不仅是因为这个业务会增长，更因为这些人是能够真正建立事业，并以良好方式运营它的人。

You know, people always ask me why I think Airbnb is such a great company. It's funny we're obsessing over Airbnb, but I say to people it's because all three founders are as good as the other founder. That is very rare. In the case of Google, two founders, one of them is a little better than the other one. Every company has a CEO. When you start a company, you have to go find somebody as good or better than you to be the cofounder. If you do that, your chances of success grow astronomically. And that's why Airbnb became so successful, so quickly. The anomaly is Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook. Yes, he has an awesome team. But the Mark Zuckerberg phenomenon where it's mainly one person, that is the outlier. So when you start a company you have got to find phenomenal co-founders.

你知道，人们总是问我为什么认为Airbnb是一家如此出色的公司。有趣的是我们对Airbnb如此着迷，但我告诉人们这是因为三位创始人都同样优秀。这种情况非常罕见。以谷歌为例，两位创始人中有一位比另一位稍强一些。每家公司都有CEO。当你创办公司时，必须找到与你同样优秀或更优秀的人作为联合创始人。如果这样做，成功的机会就会呈指数级增长。这就是为什么Airbnb能够如此迅速取得成功的原因。Facebook的马克·扎克伯格是个特例。是的，他拥有一支很棒的团队。但以一个人为主的马克·扎克伯格现象是个例外。所以当你创办公司时，必须找到出色的联合创始人。

All right. Audience questions. Yes. So obviously the conventional wisdom about why you raise money is because you need it. But the more I get off conventional wisdom the more I'm starting to hear another story about why you raise money and I'm actually hearing founders say it's more to facilitate the big exit, or in the worst case to facilitate the acqui-hire that are just fizzling out. What extent is that accurate thinking? Does raising money help you with an exit, or an acqui-hire? Well if you pick good investors who have good Rolodexes and domain expertise in what your company does, they're gonna add a lot more value than the money. And those are the types of investors you should be looking for. So the answer to the question is clearly yes. But also in a sense it doesn't matter because you can't plan these things according to the downside. I mean, that's the scenario you are obviously not hoping for. And so while the answer is yes, probably that shouldn't enter into the decision making process too much. But it might enter into which investor to raise money from, it probably doesn't enter into the whether to raise money question that much I don't think.

好的。观众提问。请讲。显然，关于为什么要融资的传统观点是因为你需要资金。但我越是脱离传统观点，就越开始听到关于融资原因的另一种说法，实际上我听到创始人们说更多是为了促成重大退出，或者在最坏情况下促成那些正在逐渐消失的收购雇佣。这种想法在多大程度上是准确的？融资是否有助于退出或收购雇佣？如果你选择了拥有良好社交网络和在你公司业务领域具有专业知识的优秀投资者，他们会比资金本身带来更多价值。这些正是你应该寻找的投资者类型。所以这个问题的答案显然是肯定的。但在某种意义上这并不重要，因为你不能根据最坏情况来规划这些事情。我的意思是，这显然不是你希望看到的局面。因此，虽然答案是肯定的，但这可能不应该过多地进入决策过程。但它可能会影响你选择从哪个投资者那里融资，我认为它可能不会过多地影响是否要融资这个问题。

I intend to start a business and grow the capital investment. I do want to end up with some equity. Do you guys have any advice about how to deal with extra amounts? People are taking so long, not everything is like software. It's viral. So this is, I would double down on my previous comments on the onion theory of risk and the staging of risk in cash. The more capital you have in the business, the more intense and serious you have to be about exactly what's going to be required to make the business work and what the staging of milestones and risks are. Because in that case, you wanna line up, you wanna be very precise of lining up. Because the risk is so high that it'll all go sideways right? So you wanna be very precise about what you're gonna accomplish with your A round and what's going to be a successful execution of the A round. Because if you raise too much money in the A round, that'll seriously screw you up later on down the road. Because you know you're gonna raise the C, D, E rounds, and then the cumulative dilution will get to be too much. So you have to be precise on every single round. You have to raise as close to the exact right amount of money as possible, and then you have to be as pure and clean and precise with the investors as you can possibly be about the risks and the milestones. But this by the way is a big thing. I'm really glad you asked the question. It kind of goes back to what Parker said. If you walk into our firm and you've got Twitter, or you've got Pinterest, you've got something and it's just viral growth and it's just on fire and it's just gonna go, those are the easy ones.

我打算创业并增加资本投资。我确实希望最终能获得一些股权。你们对处理额外资金有什么建议吗？人们花费的时间太长了，并非所有事情都像软件那样。它具有病毒式传播特性。因此，我要重申之前关于风险分层理论和现金风险分阶段的评论。企业在业务中拥有的资本越多，你就必须更加认真和严肃地考虑使业务运作所需的确切条件，以及里程碑和风险的分阶段安排。因为在这种情况下，你需要做好规划，需要非常精确地进行规划。因为风险太高，一切都可能出错，对吧？所以你需要非常精确地确定在A轮融资中要实现什么目标，以及什么才是A轮融资的成功执行。因为如果你在A轮融资中筹集过多资金，那将在后续发展中严重困扰你。因为你知道你还要进行C轮、D轮、E轮融资，然后累积的股权稀释将会变得过多。所以你必须在每一轮融资中都保持精确。你必须尽可能接近确切的正确金额进行融资，然后你必须尽可能纯粹、清晰和精确地向投资者说明风险和里程碑。但这顺便说一句是件大事。我真的很高兴你提出这个问题。这某种程度上回到了帕克所说的。如果你走进我们公司，你拥有Twitter，或者你拥有Pinterest，你拥有某种产品并且它正在病毒式增长，它正在蓬勃发展并且将继续发展，那些都是容易处理的情况。

What should Congress do for capital investment companies? It's just like, let's put money in it and feed the beast, and off it goes. But if you walk in and say, "I have this really great idea, but it's going to take $300 million staged out over the next five years, probably across five rounds." It has a potentially very big outcome, but this is not Twitter. This is going to be serious heavy lifting to be able to get there. We will still do those, but the operational excellence of the team matters a lot more. One of the ways that you can convey operational excellence is in the quality of the plan. Back to the Steve Martin thing: be so good they can't ignore you. The plans should be very precise.

国会应该为资本投资公司做些什么？这就像是，让我们投入资金，喂养这头猛兽，然后它就会自行发展。但如果你走进去说："我有一个非常好的想法，但需要3亿美元，分阶段在未来五年内投入，可能分为五轮融资。"它可能带来非常大的成果，但这可不是推特。要实现这个目标需要付出巨大的努力。我们仍然会做这些投资，但团队的卓越运营能力更为重要。展示卓越运营能力的方式之一就是计划的质量。回到史蒂夫·马丁的那句话：要做到极致，让他们无法忽视你。计划应该非常精确。

There are ways if your capital equipment is intensive. There are ways of borrowing money in addition to venture capital. You can start with venture debt and then later on use lease financing. But again, that underlines the need for operational excellence because if you're going to raise debt, then you really need to be precise in how you're running the company. It's very easy to trip the covenants on a loan, and it's very easy to lose the company. So it's a thread-the-needle process that demands a more advanced level of management than, say, the next SnapChat.

如果你的资本设备密集，还有其他方式。除了风险投资外，还有借款的方式。你可以从风险债务开始，然后使用租赁融资。但这再次强调了卓越运营的必要性，因为如果你要筹集债务，你真的需要在公司运营方面非常精确。很容易违反贷款契约，也很容易失去公司。所以这是一个需要精准把握的过程，需要比下一个SnapChat更高级的管理水平。

What are some bad signs for investors that you shouldn't work with their company? That's a good question.

有哪些不好的迹象表明你不应该与某些投资者的公司合作？这是个好问题。

How do you know what's a sign that you should avoid a particular investor? Well, it's the inverse of what I said about a good investor. If it's an investor who has no domain expertise in your company, does not have a Rolodex where they can help you with introductions, both for business development and in helping you do the intros for series A, you should not take that person's money, especially if they're in it just to make money and you can suss those people out pretty quickly.

如何判断应该避开某个特定投资者的信号？这与我之前提到的优秀投资者的特征正好相反。如果某个投资者对你的公司所在领域没有专业知识，没有人脉资源来帮助你进行业务拓展和A轮融资的介绍，你就不应该接受这个人的投资，特别是当他们仅仅是为了赚钱而来，而你可以很快识别出这类人。

Yeah, I would, glad you asked that question. Bring up sort of a broader point which is if your company is successful, we're talking about our investors are the ones that wanna build big, independent franchise companies. So we're talking about a 10 or 15 or 20 year journey. You know, 10 or 15 or 20 years you may notice is longer than the average American marriage. This is significant.

是的，我很高兴你问了这个问题。提出一个更广泛的观点：如果你的公司成功了，我们谈论的是我们的投资者是那些希望建立大型、独立特许经营公司的人。所以我们谈论的是一段10年、15年或20年的旅程。你可能注意到10年、15年或20年比美国平均婚姻时间还要长。这一点很重要。

The choice of key investors, of particular investors who are gonna be on the board for a company, I think, is just as important as who you get married to, which is extremely important. These are people you're gonna be living with, and partnering with and relying on, and dealing with in position, in conditions of great stress and anxiety for a long period of time.

我认为选择关键投资者，特别是那些将在公司董事会任职的特定投资者，与选择结婚对象同等重要，这是极其重要的。这些是你将要长期共同生活、合作、依赖并在巨大压力和焦虑状态下共事的人。

And the big argument I always make is, and ours like make this all the time, sometimes people believe it and sometimes they don't. Which is like if everything

But almost never does everything just go great. Right? Even the big successful companies, like Facebook and all these big companies that are now considered very successful, you know, along the way all kinds of shit went wrong. You know, shit hit the fan over and over and over again. And there are any number of stressful board meetings and discussions and late night meetings with the future of the company at stake, where everybody really has to be on the same team and have the same goals and be pulling in the same direction and have a shared understanding. They have the right kind of ethics and the right kind of staying power to be able to actually weather the storms that come up. And one of the things that you'll find that is a big difference between first time founders versus second time founders is almost always second time founders take that point much more seriously after they've been through it once. And so it really, really, really matters. I always thought, and I believe that it does. It really matters who your partner is. It really is like getting married, and it is worth putting the same amount of time, maybe not quite as much time and effort into picking your spouse, but it is worth spending significant time really understanding who you're about to be partnered with.

但几乎从来没有一切都能顺利进行的情况，对吧？即使是那些大型成功企业，比如Facebook和所有现在被认为非常成功的大公司，在发展的过程中也经历了各种糟糕的事情。你知道，麻烦事一次又一次地不断出现。还有无数紧张的董事会会议、讨论和深夜会议，公司的未来岌岌可危，这时每个人都必须站在同一阵线，拥有相同的目标，朝着相同的方向努力，并达成共识。他们需要具备正确的道德观和持久的耐力，才能真正度过出现的风暴。你会发现首次创业者和二次创业者之间的一个重大区别是，二次创业者几乎总是更认真地对待这一点，因为他们已经经历过一次。所以这真的非常非常重要。我一直认为，也确实相信这一点。你的合作伙伴是谁真的很重要。这真的就像结婚一样，值得投入同样的时间——也许不需要像选择配偶那样花费那么多时间和精力——但确实值得花大量时间去真正了解你将要合作的人。

Just goes great, great. I know at SV Angel, our attitude is when we invest in an entrepreneur, we are investing for life. Because we wanna invest in, if we made the right decision, we're gonna invest in every company they start. And, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur. So we actually do consider it a marriage. We're investing for life.

这真是太棒了。我知道在SV Angel，我们的态度是当我们投资一位创业者时，我们就是在进行终身投资。因为如果我们做出了正确的决定，我们想要投资他们创办的每一家公司。而且，一旦成为创业者，就永远是创业者。所以我们实际上将其视为一场婚姻。我们是在进行终身投资。

One thing that I, which is another way of saying what Mark just said, is I always look for in that first meeting: do you feel like you respect this person? And do you feel like you have a lot to learn from them? Because sometimes you walk in and they have such an incredible amount of insight in your business that you walk out of there being like, man, I don't, even if these guys didn't invest, that sort of hour that I spent with them was such a great use of my time. I felt like I came out with a much clearer picture of what I need to do and where I need to go. And that's such a great microcosm of what the next couple of years are gonna be like. You know, if you feel like you would want this person really involved in the company even if they didn't have like a checkbook that they brought with them. And if not, that's probably a very bad sign.

我要说的另一件事，也就是Mark刚才所说的另一种表达方式，就是我在第一次会面中总是寻找：你是否觉得尊重这个人？你是否觉得能从他们身上学到很多东西？因为有时候你走进去，他们对你的业务有着如此深刻的见解，以至于你走出来时会想，即使这些人没有投资，我与他们共度的那个小时也是对我时间的极大利用。我觉得我对需要做什么以及需要去哪里有了更清晰的认识。这正是未来几年合作关系的绝佳缩影。你知道，即使他们没有带着支票簿，你是否仍然希望这个人真正参与公司事务。如果不是这样，那可能是一个非常糟糕的迹象。

What's the constraint on making accurate use of angels and VCs? Time, money, or the lack of company? Well, what's the constraint on how many companies you guys invest in? SV Angels has kinda gotten comfortable with one a week. You certainly can't do more than that, and that's a staff of 13. So it's really the number of companies.

准确利用天使投资人和风险投资公司的限制因素是什么？时间、资金，还是缺乏合适的公司？那么，你们投资多少家公司的限制因素是什么？SV Angels已经基本适应了每周投资一家公司的节奏。当然不能超过这个数量，而且我们只有13名员工。所以这实际上就是公司数量的问题。

I always look for Ron. If you had, if you all worked twice the number of hours, would you invest in twice the number of companies? I would advise against that. I would rather just add value, more value to the existing companies. Maybe you could, I'll take the role of questioner for a second. Maybe you could, could you talk a little bit about conflict policy? Or not, or not conflict policy. Well SV Angel actually does have a written conflict policy. But most, when we end up with a conflict it's usually because one company has morphed into another space. We don't normally invest in companies that have a direct conflict. If we do we will disclose it to the other company, to both companies. And keep in mind at our stage, we don't know the company's project strategy anyway. We probably don't know enough to disclose. But our conflict policy also talks about this really important word, which is trust. In other words, we're off to a bad start if we don't trust each other. And with SV Angel, the relationship between the founder and us, is based on trust. And if somebody doesn't trust us then they shouldn't, they shouldn't work with us. Mark, would you invest in companies? Yeah. So this is actually. So, let me go back to the original question. I'll come back to that. So the original question is this is the thing we talk about most often in our firm.

我总是在寻找罗恩。如果你有，如果你们所有人的工作时间都翻倍，你们会投资两倍数量的公司吗？我不建议那样做。我宁愿只是增加价值，为现有公司增加更多价值。也许你可以，我暂时充当提问者的角色。也许你可以，你能谈谈冲突政策吗？或者不是，或者不是冲突政策。嗯，SV Angel实际上确实有书面的冲突政策。但大多数情况下，当我们遇到冲突时，通常是因为一家公司已经转型进入了另一个领域。我们通常不会投资有直接冲突的公司。如果我们这样做了，我们会向另一家公司，向两家公司都披露。请记住，在我们这个阶段，我们反正不知道公司的项目战略。我们可能了解得不够多，无法进行披露。但我们的冲突政策也谈到了这个非常重要的词，那就是信任。换句话说，如果我们不信任彼此，那么我们就有了一个糟糕的开始。而且，对于SV Angel来说，创始人和我们之间的关系是基于信任的。如果有人不信任我们，那么他们就不应该，他们不应该与我们合作。马克，你会投资公司吗？是的。所以这实际上是。那么，让我回到最初的问题。我稍后会回到那个问题。所以最初的问题是，这是我们公司最常讨论的事情。

So this is kind of the question at the heart of how all venture capital operates, which is a question of constraints. The big constraint on a top tier venture capital firm is the concept of opportunity cost. It's the concept that basically everything you do means that there are a whole bunch of other things that you can't do. And so, it's not so much the cost, and we think about this all the time. It's not so much the cost of investing five million dollars in a company, and the company goes wrong and we lose the money. That's not really the loss that we're worried about, because the theory is we'll have winners that'll make up for that in theory. The cost that we're worried about is every investment we make has two implications for how we run the firm. Every investment we make, number one rules out conflicts, and so for sure our policy on venture and growth rounds is that we don't invest in conflicting companies. We only invest in one company in a category. If we invest in MySpace, and then Facebook comes along a year later, we're out. We can't do it, right? And so we basically lock, every investment we make locks us out of a category. The nature of that is a very complicated topic when you're discussing these things internally in these firms at first because you only know the companies that already exist right? You don't know the companies that haven't even been founded yet right?

这实际上是所有风险投资运作核心的问题，即约束条件的问题。对于顶级风险投资公司来说，最大的约束就是机会成本的概念。这个概念基本上意味着你做的每件事都意味着有很多其他事情你无法去做。因此，我们一直在思考的并不是那种成本。并不是说我们向一家公司投资五百万美元，然后公司出了问题我们损失了资金。这实际上并不是我们担心的损失，因为理论上我们会有成功的投资来弥补这些损失。我们担心的成本是，我们做的每项投资对我们运营公司都有两个影响。我们做的每项投资，第一是排除了冲突，所以我们在风险投资和成长轮投资上的政策肯定是不会投资相互冲突的公司。我们在每个类别只投资一家公司。如果我们投资了MySpace，然后一年后Facebook出现了，我们就出局了。我们无法投资，对吧？所以我们基本上被锁定了，我们做的每项投资都将我们排除在一个类别之外。当你最初在这些公司内部讨论这些事情时，这个性质是一个非常复杂的话题，因为你只知道已经存在的公司，对吧？你甚至不知道那些尚未成立的公司，对吧？

God help you if you had invested in an early company that was not going to be the winner and you were locked out by the time the winner emerged three years later and you just couldn't make the investment. So that's one issue: conflict policy. The other issue is opportunity cost. The time and bandwidth of the general partners, going back to the concept of adding value - we're a fairly typical firm with eight general partners. Each general partner can maybe be on 10 to 12 boards in total if they're completely fully loaded. Warren Buffett talks a lot about investing as basically thinking of it as a ticket that you have a limited amount of holes you can punch. Every time you make an investment you punch the hole, and when you're out of holes to punch, you're done and can't make any new investments. That's very much how venture capital operates. The way to think about it is every open board slot that one of our GPs has at any given point in time is an asset of the firm that can be deployed against an opportunity. But every time we make an investment, it takes the number of slots that we can punch down by one, reducing the ability for the firm to do new deals. Every investment we make forecloses not just the competitive set, but other deals where we will simply run out of time.

如果你投资了一家早期公司，而这家公司最终不会成为赢家，当三年后真正的赢家出现时，你却因各种限制无法进行投资，那可就麻烦了。这就是一个问题：利益冲突政策。另一个问题是机会成本。普通合伙人的时间和精力，回到创造价值的概念上——我们是一家相当典型的公司，有八位普通合伙人。如果完全满负荷工作，每位普通合伙人可能总共能在10到12个董事会任职。沃伦·巴菲特经常谈到投资，基本上可以将其视为一张票，你只能打有限数量的孔。每次进行投资就像打一个孔，当孔用完时，你就不能再进行任何新的投资。这非常符合风险投资的运作方式。理解这一点的方式是：我们的任何一位普通合伙人在任何时间点拥有的每个开放董事会席位都是公司可以用于把握机会的资产。但每次我们进行投资，可用的席位数量就会减少一个，从而降低了公司进行新交易的能力。我们进行的每项投资不仅排除了竞争组合，还排除了其他我们最终会因时间不足而无法参与的交易。

And so, this is sort of a big thing: why didn't you fund it? Well, on its own if we had unlimited capacity we probably would have. Like it'll probably make money. But relative to getting blocked out of the competitive set and relative to not having that open seat for an even better opportunity, we pass on that basis a lot.

所以，这其实是个重要问题：为什么你们没有投资？如果单看这个项目，假设我们有无限的资金容量，我们很可能会投资。因为它很可能赚钱。但考虑到可能被排除在竞争组合之外，以及可能无法为更好的机会保留空位，我们经常基于这些考虑而放弃投资。

It's pretty widely agreed that it's easier than ever to build an MVP, launch it, and get traction. At the same time we know that there are CPOs that have been pre-MVP or even pre-launch and pre-traction. So in those instances where you do a seed round with a company that either doesn't have a product or doesn't have impressive traction, what do those deals look like and what do you make that judgment based on? What convinces you to invest in a product with no traction?

人们普遍认为，如今构建最小可行产品、发布并获得用户关注比以往任何时候都更容易。同时我们也知道有些首席产品官在最小可行产品之前，甚至在发布和获得用户关注之前就已经存在。那么，在这些情况下，当你与一家既没有产品也没有令人印象深刻的用户关注度的公司进行种子轮投资时，这些交易是什么样的？你基于什么做出判断？是什么说服你投资一个没有用户关注度的产品？

What would convince us, which is what usually convinces us, is the founder and their team themselves. So we invest in people first, not necessarily the product idea. The product ideas tend to morph a lot. So we will invest in the team first. If it's pre-users, the valuation is gonna tend to be correspondingly lower unless one of the founders has a success track record.

能够说服我们的，通常也是真正说服我们的，是创始人及其团队本身。所以我们首先投资的是人，而不一定是产品创意。产品创意往往会经历很多变化。因此我们会首先投资团队。如果是用户之前的阶段，估值往往会相应较低，除非其中一位创始人有着成功的过往记录。

Yeah, for us it's almost always, if there's nothing at the time of investment, then it's almost, other than a plan it's almost always the founder who we've worked with before or a founder who's very well known. By the way the other thing worth highlighting is, in these conversations, in all these conversations, you kind of default to certain assumptions.

是的，对我们来说几乎总是这样，如果在投资时什么都没有，那么除了计划之外，几乎总是我们之前合作过的创始人或非常知名的创始人。顺便说一句，另一个值得强调的事情是，在这些对话中，在所有这类对话中，你往往会默认某些假设。

In these conversations, the default assumption is that we're all starter web companies or consumer mobile companies. There are other categories of companies, such as capital-intensive ones that have been brought up. For example, enterprise software companies, or enterprise SaaS, application companies, or cloud companies these days. It's much more common that there's no MVP. It's much more common that they're a cold start. And it's much more common that they build a product in the A round. Then there's no point to have an MVP because the customer's not going to buy an MVP. The customer actually needs the full product when they first start using it. And so the company actually needs to raise 5 or 10 million dollars to get the first product built. But in almost all those cases, that's going to be a founder who's done it before.

在这些讨论中，默认假设我们都是初创网络公司或消费移动公司。实际上还有其他类型的公司，比如之前提到的资本密集型公司。例如，企业软件公司，或者如今的企业SaaS、应用程序公司或云服务公司。更常见的情况是没有最小可行产品。更常见的情况是冷启动。而且更常见的是他们在A轮融资阶段才构建产品。这样一来就没有必要开发最小可行产品，因为客户不会购买最小可行产品。客户在开始使用时实际上需要完整的产品。因此，公司实际上需要筹集500万到1000万美元来构建第一个产品。但在几乎所有这类情况下，这都会是之前有过相关经验的创始人。

I think we have time for one more question. It shouldn't really be an issue because there are so few. I mean things almost never come to like a board vote. And by the time that they do, it's like something's deeply broken at that point anyway. Most of the power that VCs have comes outside of the board structure. It's protective covenants that are built into the financing round, so it's like you can't take on debt, you can't sell the company. There are certain things that you can't do without them agreeing to it anyway. So it's probably like less of a big deal than people make it out to be.

我想我们还有时间再回答一个问题。这应该不是什么大问题，因为这种情况很少发生。我的意思是，事情几乎从来不会发展到需要董事会投票的地步。等到真的需要投票时，通常意味着某些方面已经出现了严重问题。风险投资人的大部分权力都来自董事会结构之外。这些是在融资轮次中设立的保护性条款，比如你不能承担债务，不能出售公司。有些事情无论如何都需要他们的同意才能进行。所以这可能没有人们想象的那么重要。

What I found is that it seems to me that, as a founder, if things are going well at the company, you have sort of unlimited power vis-à-vis your investors. Like, almost unlimited. No matter what the board structure is, and no matter what the covenants are in the round. If you say, "Listen, I wanna do this, and I think this is what we need to do." And even if it's a good investor or a bad investor, even the bad investors will be like, "Let's make it happen." Because they wanna ride this rocket ship with you.

我发现，作为创始人，如果公司运营良好，相对于投资者，你几乎拥有无限的权力。几乎是无限的。无论董事会结构如何，无论融资轮次中有哪些条款。如果你说："听着，我想这样做，我认为这是我们需要做的。"无论是好的投资者还是差的投资者，即使是差的投资者也会说："让我们实现它吧。"因为他们想和你一起搭乘这艘火箭飞船。

And when things are going badly, it does not matter what protections you've built into the system for yourself. At the end of the day, you need to go back to the trough to get more money. If things aren't going well, they're gonna have all of the cards in their hand. And they're gonna get to renegotiate all the terms.

而当事情进展不顺时，你在系统中为自己建立的保护措施就无关紧要了。归根结底，你需要回去寻求更多资金。如果事情进展不顺利，他们就会掌握所有的牌。他们将能够重新谈判所有条款。

And, exactly they'll change all the terms. This is what happens actually when a company gets in dire straights. It actually doesn't matter what the terms, but at fire rounds they all get renegotiated.

而且，他们确实会改变所有条款。这就是当公司陷入困境时实际会发生的情况。条款内容实际上并不重要，但在紧急融资轮次中，所有条款都会被重新谈判。

This is I think the fundamental rule of raising money. Other than never having down turns is that if things are going well the founder is in control and the company needs more money and things going badly, if investors are in control.

我认为这是融资的基本规则。除了永远不会有低谷期之外，就是如果事情进展顺利，创始人掌握控制权，公司需要更多资金；如果事情进展不顺，投资者就会掌握控制权。

I've been on boards for 20 years public and private, I have never been a board vote that mattered. It's always been never, never a vote. Many discussions, many controversies, many issues. Never a vote. It's the decision has always been clear by the end. And it's either by unanimous or very close to unanimous.

我在上市公司和私营公司的董事会任职已有20年，从未经历过真正重要的董事会投票。从来、从来都不是通过投票决定的。有很多讨论、很多争议、很多问题。但从未通过投票。最终决定总是很明确。要么是全体一致，要么是接近全体一致。

And so I think it is almost all around the intangibles and almost not at all around the details. Okay. Thank you guys very much for coming in today. Pleasure.

所以我认为这几乎完全取决于无形因素，而几乎完全不取决于细节。好的。非常感谢大家今天能来。很荣幸。
