So I'm going to talk about how to operate. I've watched some of the prior classes, and I'm going to assume that you've already hired a bunch of horrendously resourceful people, that you've built a product that at least some people love, and you're probably raised some capital. Now you're trying to build a company. So you're forging a product and now you have to forge a company. I would actually argue that forging a company is much more difficult than forging a product. The basic reason is people are irrational. You probably all know this from your parents, your significant other, your brother or sister, or your teacher - somebody in your life is irrational. Building a company is basically taking all the irrational people you know, putting them in one building and then living with them 12 hours a day at least. So it's very challenging. Now, there are techniques for coping with that, and some people get good at it and some people don't, but that's really what operating is about. Basically what you're doing when you build a company is you're building an engine. At first you have a drawing literally on a whiteboard, and you're architecting it, and it looks very conceptually clean, beautiful, and pretty. But when you start actually translating to practice, it actually looks more like this, and you're holding it together with duct tape. It takes a lot of heroic effort from people to actually hold it together. That's why people work 80, 100 hours a week - that heroic effort is actually necessary to keep this thing together.

我将要讨论如何运营公司。我观看过之前的一些课程，并且我假设你们已经雇佣了一批极其足智多谋的人才，你们已经开发出至少部分用户喜爱的产品，而且你们可能已经筹集了一些资金。现在你们正试图建立一家公司。你们已经打造了产品，现在必须打造公司。实际上我认为打造公司比打造产品要困难得多。基本原因是人都是非理性的。你们可能都从父母、伴侣、兄弟姐妹或老师那里了解这一点——生活中总有些人是非理性的。建立公司基本上就是把所有你认识的非理性人聚集在同一栋大楼里，然后每天至少与他们共处12小时。所以这非常具有挑战性。现在有一些应对技巧，有些人擅长于此而有些人不擅长，但这正是运营的真正含义。当你建立公司时，本质上是在建造一台引擎。最初你只是在白板上画草图，进行架构设计，它在概念上看起来非常简洁、美观和漂亮。但当你开始实际实施时，它实际上看起来更像这样，你只能用胶带勉强维持它的运转。需要人们付出大量英勇的努力才能让它维持运转。这就是为什么人们每周工作80到100小时——这种英勇的努力确实是维持事物运转所必需的。

Because you don't actually yet have polished metal in place. Eventually you want to construct a high performance machine. A machine that actually almost nobody really has to worry about every hour. Every minute and as we used to joke about Ebay, if Martians took over Ebay it would take like six months for the world to notice. That's what eventually what you want to get to. Or as Warren Buffet says, build a company that idiots could run because eventually they will. So this is what you want basically a performance machine that idiots can run.

因为你实际上还没有完善的机制。最终你想要构建一个高性能的机器。一个几乎没有人需要时时刻刻担心的机器。就像我们过去常开玩笑说eBay那样，如果火星人接管了eBay，全世界可能要六个月后才会注意到。这就是你最终想要达到的目标。或者就像沃伦·巴菲特所说，建立一个傻瓜都能经营的公司，因为最终他们确实会来经营。所以这基本上就是你想要的，一个傻瓜都能操作的性能机器。

Now, as a leader, what is your real job? What's your role? Strictly speaking there's only one book that's ever written that actually explains how to do this. It was written in 1992 by Andy Grove, who's quite famous and successful. His definition of what your job is, is to maximize the output of an organization, your organization that you're responsible for. CEOs are responsible for everything and a VP would be part of the organization. And the organizations around you, so if you're VPE, you're actually responsible for the performance of the product team too, or the marketing team, because you have influence there.

现在，作为领导者，你真正的工作是什么？你的角色是什么？严格来说，只有一本书真正解释了如何做到这一点。这本书由安迪·格鲁夫于1992年撰写，他非常有名且成功。他对你工作的定义是最大化一个组织的产出，即你所负责的组织的产出。CEO要对所有事情负责，而副总裁则是组织的一部分。还有你周围的组织，所以如果你是工程副总裁，你实际上也要对产品团队或营销团队的表现负责，因为你在那里有影响力。

So this is how you measure people and you want to focus on the output not the input. The old adage about measuring motion and confusing that with progress, you're measuring only progress. And this is going to sound like a fancy and glamorous thing to do. Maybe people get excited about managing a whole large organization, and being responsible for the output. But in practice, what you're going to learn today hopefully is that it's more about things like ordering smoothies.

所以这就是你衡量人的方式，你要关注的是产出而非投入。那句关于衡量行动并将其与进展混淆的老话，你只衡量进展。这听起来像是一件时髦而迷人的事情。也许人们会对管理整个大型组织并对产出负责感到兴奋。但在实践中，希望你今天能学到的是，这更多是关于像点冰沙这样的小事。

Teaching your receptionist how to answer the phone properly, and serving as a $10 an hour task rabbit for your employees. So let's talk about that. So at first when you start a company everything's going to feel like a mess. And it really should if you have too much process, too much predictability you're probably not innovating fast enough and creatively enough. So it should feel like everyday there's a new problem and what you're doing is fundamentally triaging. So some things will look like a problem, and they're actually a cold, they're just going to go away. So, somebody's annoyed about this or that. That may be a cold, and you shouldn't stress about it, and you certainly shouldn't allocate a lot of your time to it. And some things are going to present themselves as colds. But just like in the emergency room, if they're not diagnosed properly they actually can become fatal. So what I'm going to try to do is help give you frameworks for thinking about which things are colds and which things are potentially fatal. So one of the most important things I've learned at Square is actually a concept of editing.

教导前台如何正确接听电话，以及为员工充当每小时10美元的任务跑腿人。让我们来谈谈这个问题。最初当你创办公司时，一切都会显得混乱不堪。而如果流程过多、可预测性过高，这种混乱反而是应该的，因为这意味着你可能没有足够快速和富有创意地进行创新。因此，每天都会遇到新问题，你实际上是在进行根本性的分诊工作。有些问题看似严重，实际上只是普通感冒，它们会自行消失。比如有人对某些事情感到不满，这可能只是小问题，你不必为此焦虑，更不应该投入大量时间。而有些问题表面上看起来像是小毛病，但就像在急诊室里一样，如果诊断不当，它们实际上可能变得致命。我试图做的是为你提供思考框架，帮助你区分哪些是普通问题，哪些可能具有致命风险。我在Square学到的最重要的一点就是编辑这个概念。

It's a natural construct. You generally know when someone asks you to do something. Am I more writing or am I more editing? So an editor is the best metaphor for your job, and we're talking about the specific things you're doing in editing. The first thing an editor does, and you probably all had this experience in school, is you submit a paper to a TA, a draft to your friend. And the first thing an editor does is they take out a red pen or nowadays, you know online, and they start striking things. Basically eliminating things. The most important task as an editor is to simplify, simplify, and that usually means omitting things. So that's your job too, is to clarify and simplify for everybody on your team. The more you simplify the better people will perform. People cannot understand and keep track of a complicated set of initiatives. So you've got to distill it down to one, two, or three things. And use a framework that they can repeat, they can repeat without thinking about, they can repeat to their friends, they can repeat at night. Don't accept the excuse of complexity. A lot of people will tell you that well this is too challenging, this is too complicated. Well yeah, I know other people simplify but that's not for me. This is a complicated business. They're wrong. You can change the world in 140 characters. You can build the most important companies in history in a very simple to describe concept. You can market products in less than about 50 characters. There's no reason why you can't build your company the same way. So force yourself to simplify every initiative, every product, every marketing, everything you do.

这是一个自然的构建过程。当有人要求你做什么事时，你通常都能意识到。我更像是在写作还是在编辑？因此，编辑是你工作的最佳比喻，我们讨论的是你在编辑过程中所做的具体事情。编辑做的第一件事，你们在学校可能都有过这种经历，就是你把论文交给助教，把草稿交给朋友。编辑做的第一件事就是拿出红笔，或者现在在网上，开始删除内容。基本上是消除内容。作为编辑最重要的任务是简化、再简化，这通常意味着省略内容。所以你的工作也是如此，就是为团队中的每个人澄清和简化。你越是简化，人们的表现就越好。人们无法理解并跟踪复杂的计划组合。所以你必须将其提炼成一、两或三件事。并使用一个他们能够重复的框架，他们可以不假思索地重复，可以向朋友重复，可以在晚上重复。不要接受复杂性的借口。很多人会告诉你这太有挑战性了，这太复杂了。是的，我知道其他人会简化，但这不适合我。这是一个复杂的业务。他们错了。你可以用140个字符改变世界。你可以用非常简单的概念描述来建立历史上最重要的公司。你可以用不到50个字符来营销产品。你没有理由不能用同样的方式建立你的公司。所以要强迫自己简化每一个计划、每一个产品、每一个营销、你所做的一切。

And basically take out that red, and start eliminating stuff. The second thing is what editors do is they ask you clarifying questions. So when you present a paper to somebody, what do they usually do? Do they find some ambiguity somewhere and say, "Well, did you really mean this? Do you mean that? Do you have an example of this?" That's what your job is. So you're in a meeting and people are going to look to you, and the real thing you do is you actually ask a lot of questions. They can be simple, basic questions like, "Should we try this seven days a week or six days?" They can be fundamental questions like, "Where's our competitive advantage here?" We try to do this actually as investors too. Some investors will ask you a billion questions about a billion things and they'll have you do diligence forever. We try to narrow it down to what are one, two, three, or four things that actually matter for this company and only focus on those things. So it allows us to be more decisive, and we can make decisions rapidly. It allows us not to distract you from your day job, which is actually building a company. And yet, I think we still get to the higher fidelity answers. We don't have all these extra, extraneous details, pieces of data. Now it's hard, it's something you have to practice, but when you're good at it, every step you eliminate, Andy Grove estimated that you can improve performance by 30-50%. The next thing you do is allocate resources. So the editing construct, this is what editors do all the time.

基本上就是去掉那些红色标记，开始剔除不必要的内容。编辑做的第二件事是提出澄清性问题。当你向某人提交论文时，他们通常会怎么做？他们是否会在某些地方发现歧义，然后问："你真正想表达的是这个吗？你是那个意思吗？你有这方面的例子吗？"这就是你的工作。所以在会议中，大家会指望你，而你真正要做的是提出大量问题。这些问题可以是简单基础的，比如"我们应该每周尝试七天还是六天？"也可以是根本性的问题，比如"我们的竞争优势在哪里？"作为投资者，我们也在努力这样做。有些投资者会问你无数个问题，让你永远做尽职调查。我们试图将其缩小到真正对这家公司重要的一、二、三或四件事，并只关注这些事。这让我们能更果断，快速做出决策。这也能避免让你从本职工作——即真正建设公司——中分心。然而，我认为我们仍然能得到更高保真度的答案。我们没有所有这些额外的、无关的细节和数据片段。这很难，需要练习，但当你擅长时，安迪·格鲁夫估计，每消除一个步骤，性能就能提高30-50%。接下来要做的是分配资源。这就是编辑结构，编辑们一直在这样做。

They take editors from the mid-East covering the mid-East and move them to Silicon Valley, because Silicon Valley is now more interesting. Or they move them to a sports section because they want to compete on the basis of sports with other journals and publications. So that can be top down where I take a bunch of resources and people would say, we're now going over here, we're going to compete on this basis. And then next month, next quarter, next year, I'm like well, that Middle East coverage is getting boring and bland. We don't want to do that anymore. Let's go chase after something else, or it can be bottom up, just like journalists mostly come up with their own stories. The people who work with you generally should be coming up with their own initiatives. So, a reporter who covers Google will generally come up with the interesting stories that they're hearing and propose one or two to their editor for approval. But it's not like the editor is saying, go cover Google, and this is the angle I want. Once in a while they do that, but that's not the meat and potatoes of what a journalist does every day. Your goal over time is to actually use less red ink every day. So one way of measuring how well you're doing in communicating to your colleagues about what's important and what's not, why some things are important and some things are not, is how much red ink you're using every day. It's okay if you have a bad day and the red ink is all over the place. But it's not okay if the red ink next month is more than it was last month, if the next quarter is more than this.

他们将负责中东地区报道的中东编辑调往硅谷，因为硅谷现在更有吸引力。或者将他们调往体育部门，因为他们想要在体育报道方面与其他期刊和出版物竞争。这可以是自上而下的方式，我调配一批资源，然后人们会说，我们现在要转向这个领域，我们要在这个基础上竞争。然后到了下个月、下个季度或明年，我就会觉得中东报道变得乏味平淡。我们不想再继续这样做了。让我们去追逐其他内容，或者也可以是自下而上的方式，就像记者大多自己发掘新闻线索一样。与你共事的人通常应该主动提出自己的方案。因此，负责报道谷歌的记者通常会根据他们听到的有趣消息提出一两个选题，并提交给编辑审批。但并不是编辑命令说"去报道谷歌，我要从这个角度"。虽然偶尔他们会这样做，但这并非记者日常工作的主要内容。随着时间推移，你的目标是每天实际使用的红笔批注越来越少。衡量你与同事沟通工作重点、解释某些事情为何重要或不重要的效果如何，一个方法就是看你每天使用多少红笔批注。如果某天状态不好，批注满篇都是可以理解的。但如果下个月的红笔批注比上个月多，下个季度比这个季度多，那就不应该了。

So measure yourself of how much red ink you're creating. The other thing that's very important that actually isn't as intuitive to a lot of people is, the job of an editor is to ensure consistent voice. So if any of you read The Economist, you can tell that there's one consistent voice. You can pick up any article, any post in The Economist, and it feels like it's written by the same person. Ideally your company should feel like, on your website and your PR release, on your packaging, if it's a physical product, anywhere on your recruiting pages to feel like it was written by one person. That's extremely difficult to do, and first you're going to be tempted to do that yourself which is okay for a founder to do. Him or herself initially. Over time you do not want to be doing all of the consistent voice editing by yourself. You train people so that they can recognize the differences in voice. So if you see this website page looks very different than the recruiting page, you start by asking questions why is that? Is the reporting messed up? Is the leadership over here not really understanding the voice of the company? So, you've got to fix that over time. But you want to start with the objective of everything should feel exactly the same. It's quite, quite difficult in practice. Almost every company has at least one piece of the organization that isn't exactly on the same voice. At Apple, which is notorious, you know, even under Steve's regime, which was notorious for getting this right.

所以要衡量自己制造了多少"红墨水"。另一个非常重要但对很多人来说并不那么直观的事情是，编辑的工作是确保一致的语调。如果你们有人读过《经济学人》，你们能听出其中有一个一致的语调。你可以拿起《经济学人》的任何文章、任何帖子，感觉都像是同一个人写的。理想情况下，你的公司应该让人感觉，在你的网站和新闻稿上，在你的包装上（如果是实体产品），在你招聘页面的任何地方，都像是同一个人写的。这非常难以做到，首先你会想要自己来做这件事，这对创始人来说是可以的。最初由他或她自己来做。但随着时间的推移，你不想自己完成所有保持语调一致性的编辑工作。你要培训员工，使他们能够识别语调的差异。所以如果你看到这个网站页面看起来与招聘页面非常不同，你首先要问为什么会这样？是报告搞砸了吗？是这里的领导层没有真正理解公司的语调吗？所以，你必须随着时间的推移来解决这个问题。但你要从所有内容都应该感觉完全一致这个目标开始。这在实践中相当困难。几乎每家公司都至少有一个部门的语调不完全一致。以苹果公司为例，众所周知，即使在史蒂夫的管理下，虽然以在这方面做得好而闻名。

[如果你问苹果公司的员工关于招聘的内部工具，他们是否真的觉得这些工具像苹果产品？所有人都会告诉你不是。所以你永远无法达到百分百完美，但肯定要尽可能接近这个目标。]

[现在授权的问题是，实际上你要对一切负责。作为创始人CEO，没有任何借口，不能说"那是那个部门的问题"。如果那边的人搞砸了，你永远要对每件事负责，特别是当事情出错时。]

[那么如何在授权的同时又不放弃责任？这是个相当棘手的挑战，两者都是错误。如果你过度授权或者你过度管理，这两种都是错误。]

The less they're trying something new, the more you're going to actually instruct them and consistently, constantly, regularly monitor. So that's kind of a basic concept but it's worth keeping in the back of your brain. The interesting implication, and this is pretty radical, is that any executive, any CEO should not have one management style. Your management style actually needs to be dictated by your employee. So with one particular person, you may be very much a micro manager because they're quite low on this scale. And with another person you may be delegating a lot because they're actually quite mature on this scale. So it's actually a good thing if you do reference checks on somebody, and half the people you call say they're a micro manager, and the other half say they actually give me a lot of responsibility, that's actually not a bug, that's a feature. I didn't understand that at first, at all, like I used to be befuddled when people would do reference checks on me, and come back with this like, complicated mosaic. And that basically, finally figured out that maybe I was actually doing my job correctly, and so then of course, thought other people that this was the way to do it. A more nuanced answer though, that I've sort of came up with, is how do you make decisions? And delegating versus doing it yourself. You don't want to do it yourself too often. So what I've basically borrowed from Peter, this is my first two by two matrix ever in my life but he taught me something at least is you basically sort your own level conviction about a decision on a grid you know, extremely high, extremely low.

当他们尝试新事物越少时，你就越需要实际指导他们，并持续、不断地定期监督。这虽然是个基本概念，但值得牢记于心。一个有趣且相当激进的启示是，任何高管、任何CEO都不应该只有一种管理风格。你的管理风格实际上需要根据员工的情况来调整。对于某个特定的人，你可能需要采取微观管理，因为他们在这一维度上水平较低。而对于另一个人，你可能会大量授权，因为他们在这一维度上相当成熟。因此，当你对某人进行背景调查时，如果一半人说他们是微观管理者，而另一半人说他们实际上给了我很多责任，这实际上不是缺陷，而是特点。我最初完全不理解这一点，当人们对我进行背景调查并得出这种复杂的拼图般的结果时，我常常感到困惑。后来我终于明白，也许我实际上是在正确地完成我的工作，于是当然认为其他人也应该这样做。不过，我提出的一个更细致的答案是：你如何做决策？授权与亲力亲为之间的选择。你不想太频繁地亲力亲为。我从彼得那里借鉴的基本方法是，这是我人生中第一次使用二乘二矩阵，但他至少教会了我一点：你基本上要根据自己对决策的确信程度在一个网格上排序，从极高到极低。

There are times when you know something's a mistake, and there are times where you wouldn't do it that way, but you have no real idea whether it's the right or wrong answer. And then there's a consequence to mention: there are things that if you make the wrong decision are actually catastrophic to your company and you will fail. There are things that are pretty low impact, that really at the end of the day aren't going to make a big difference, at least initially. So what I basically believe is that where there's low consequences, and you have very low confidence in your own opinion, you should absolutely delegate, and delegate completely like people make mistakes and learn. On the other side obviously, where the consequences are extremely dramatic and you have extremely high conviction that you're right, you actually can't let your junior colleague make a mistake. You're ultimately responsible for that mistake, and if it's really important you just can't allow that to happen. Now the best way to do that is to actually explain your thinking, the why. It's easy to shortcut when you get busy, explaining why's of the world, but it's very important to try. When I was at LinkedIn I had a colleague who's quite talented. On both occasions we get annoyed if I didn't exactly agree with his opinion on something, and so I spent a lot of time trying to persuade him why I was making a decision a certain way. And his wildcard, the card he would ultimately call out if I didn't quite persuade him, he's like, okay you're the boss, and that meant to me like I was burning a lot of social capital. Every time he said that, I knew I was really creating a thin line.

有些时候你知道某件事是个错误，有些时候你不会那样做，但你并不真正知道这是正确还是错误的答案。然后需要提到后果：有些事情如果你做出错误决定，实际上会对你的公司造成灾难性后果，你会失败。有些事情影响相当小，实际上最终不会产生太大差异，至少在最初阶段是这样。所以我基本相信的是，在后果较小且你对自己意见信心很低的情况下，你绝对应该授权，完全授权，就像人们会犯错并学习一样。另一方面很明显，当后果极其严重且你坚信自己是正确的时候，你实际上不能让你的初级同事犯错。你最终要对那个错误负责，如果事情真的很重要，你就不能允许这种情况发生。现在最好的方法实际上是解释你的思考过程，解释为什么。当你忙碌时很容易走捷径，不去解释世界的原因，但尝试非常重要。当我在LinkedIn时，有一位相当有才华的同事。在两种情况下，如果我没有完全同意他对某事的意见，我们都会感到恼火，所以我花了很多时间试图说服他我为什么以某种方式做决定。而他的王牌，如果我没有完全说服他时他最终会打出的牌，他会说："好吧，你是老板"，这对我来说意味着我在消耗大量的社交资本。每次他这么说，我知道我真的是在走钢丝。

Ultimately that was going to backfire if I did that too often, so you want to track the times that you're doing that. Example of this is Squares, one of my favorite people in the world, and my second hire, first marketing hire had this program he wanted to run called Inner-Square, which basically allowed people to give out square merchants to get out ten other squares to their call. Just imagine a food truck outside, put like ten squares on the counter and people could just grab them, and Kyle had this great idea, this would be this awesome marketing program. Squares would spread squares to other people and, to some extent it was on brand, so it didn't have catastrophic consequences. Each of these ten squares didn't cost that much money, so financially we could afford to do it. But, at that time my ten years of experience said there's just no way this is going to work in a meaningful enough scale, to move our metrics enough and I actually would prefer we don't do this. But Kyle was so excited about this that I decided to just let him do it. He learned that actually when you measure this thing it's not massive. It doesn't create a massive value for the company. It did require a fair amount of operational complexity to ship all these squares to people and figure out how to get them to be squares etc. But it allowed him to be excited about his job and to learn how to filter future ideas, so it's totally worth letting him make the quote unquote mistake. The next and most possibly most important thing you do is actually edit the team.

如果我经常那样做，最终会适得其反，所以你需要记录自己这样做的次数。以Squares为例，这是我在世界上最欣赏的人之一，我的第二位员工、第一位市场营销员工想要推行一个名为"内部方块"的项目，该项目基本上允许人们分发方块商户，以便获得另外十个方块。想象一下外面的餐车，在柜台上放十个方块，人们可以直接拿走它们。凯尔有个很棒的想法，认为这会是个很棒的营销项目。方块会将方块传播给其他人，在某种程度上这符合品牌定位，所以不会带来灾难性后果。这十个方块每个成本都不高，从财务角度我们能够承担。但当时我十年的经验告诉我，这绝不可能达到足够有意义的规模，无法显著提升我们的指标，实际上我更希望我们不要这样做。但凯尔对此如此兴奋，我决定让他放手去做。他认识到，当你实际衡量这件事时，它并不具有巨大影响力。它没有为公司创造巨大价值。确实需要相当复杂的运营流程来向人们寄送所有这些方块，并想办法让他们成为方块用户等等。但这让他对自己的工作充满热情，并学会了如何筛选未来的想法，所以完全值得让他犯这个所谓的"错误"。接下来，可能是你工作中最重要的事情，就是编辑团队。

So these are the people that you work with, and perfect team and you're certainly not going to start that way. So what I'm going to try to do is maximize the probability for success in editing the team. I like this idea of Barrels and Ammunition. Most companies once they get into hiring mode, as Sam pointed out you should defer that for awhile, but once you do they just hire a lot of people. And you expect as you add people your throughput, your horsepower, or your velocity of shipping things is going to increase. It turns out it doesn't work that way. Usually when you hire more engineers you actually don't get that much more done, you actually sometimes get less done. You hire more designers, you definitely don't get more done, you get less done per day. We could talk about why. But the reason why is that most people, most great people even, are actually ammunition. But what you need in your company are barrels, and you can only shoot through the number of unique barrels you have. So that's how the velocity of your company improves is by adding barrels, and then you stock them with ammunition, and then you can do a lot. So if you go from a one barrel company, which is mostly how you start, to two barrel companies suddenly you get twice as many things done per day, per week, per quarter. And if you go to three barrels, great, if you go to four barrels, awesome. Barrels are incredibly difficult to find, but when you have them, give them lots of equity, promote them, take them to dinner every week because they're virtually irreplaceable. Because they're also very culturally specific.

这些就是与你共事的人，完美的团队绝不是一开始就能建立的。因此，我试图做的是最大化团队调整的成功概率。我很喜欢"炮管与弹药"这个理念。大多数公司一旦进入招聘模式，正如萨姆指出的，你应该推迟一段时间再招聘，但一旦开始，他们就会大量招人。你会期望随着人员增加，你的产出量、马力或交付速度都会提升。但事实证明并非如此。通常当你雇佣更多工程师时，实际完成的工作并不会增加多少，有时反而更少。雇佣更多设计师时，肯定无法完成更多工作，每日产出反而下降。我们可以探讨其原因。原因在于大多数人，甚至是大多数优秀人才，实际上只是弹药。而公司真正需要的是炮管，你只能通过拥有的独特炮管数量来发射弹药。因此，提升公司速度的方法就是增加炮管，然后为其配备弹药，这样就能完成大量工作。所以如果你从单炮管公司起步——这通常是创业初期的状态，发展到双炮管公司时，你会突然发现每日、每周、每季度完成的工作量翻倍。如果发展到三个炮管，很棒；发展到四个炮管，非常出色。炮管极其难寻，但当你拥有他们时，要给予大量股权，晋升他们，每周共进晚餐，因为他们几乎不可替代。因为他们也具有很强的文化特异性。

So a barrel at one company may not be a barrel at another company, because one of the ways in the definition of a barrel is they can take an idea from inception all the way through shipping and bring people with them. And that's a very culturally specific opportunity specific skill set, rather. So two questions probably are occurring to you: how do you figure out who's a barrel and who's not? One is you start actually with a very small set of responsibilities. It can be fairly trivial. It can be something like, I want to reward the engineers that are in my office at 9 o'clock at night every night with an ice cold fresh smoothie. This is actually a real example. I was frustrated our engineers were working really hard at square. And maybe 20% to 30% would stay very late into evening, and I wanted to serve, we were ready to serve them dinner but I wanted to give them something cool to reward them, and you could think about alcohol, but that's a little complicated. So smoothies were probably a little bit better than the pizza, which drains you of energy. But nobody could get smoothies in my office to show up at 9 o'clock sharp that were cold, that tasted good and delivered in the right place that engineers would find them. You'd think this is simple, but in fact, it took months to get this right. So then we had an intern start, and I think on his second day, I was explaining this problem and he said, well, I'll do it, and I was like looking at and I'm like there's no way. I've seen my office manager fail, my assistant fail, all who are actually pretty good.

因此，在一家公司被视为核心骨干的人，在另一家公司可能就不是了。因为定义核心骨干的标准之一是，他们能够将一个想法从概念阶段一直推进到产品交付，并带动他人一起参与。这实际上是一种非常具有文化特定性的机会特定技能组合。可能你现在脑海中浮现两个问题：如何判断谁是核心骨干，谁不是？其中一个方法是，你实际上可以从非常小的职责范围开始。这可以相当微不足道。比如，我想用冰镇新鲜奶昔奖励那些每晚9点还在办公室加班的工程师。这实际上是一个真实案例。当时我很沮丧，因为我们的工程师在Square工作非常努力。大约20%到30%的人会工作到深夜，我想为他们做点什么，我们本来准备提供晚餐，但我想给他们一些更酷的东西作为奖励。你可能会想到酒精饮料，但那有点复杂。所以奶昔可能比披萨要好一些，因为披萨会消耗你的能量。但在我办公室，没有人能够在9点整准时提供冰镇、美味且送到工程师能找到的正确位置的奶昔。你可能觉得这很简单，但实际上，我们花了几个月才搞定这件事。后来我们招了一名实习生，我想是在他第二天上班时，我向他解释这个问题，他说："我来做吧。"我当时看着他，心想这不可能。我见过我的办公室经理失败，我的助理失败，他们其实都相当能干。

This just isn't going to happen, and then lo and behold that night they show up on time, cold, delivered to the right place. My first instinct was great, nothing about the smoothies. But okay, now I can actually give you something more important and inconsequential and complicated to do, and that's what you actually want to do with every single employee every single day: expand the scope of their responsibilities until it breaks, and it will break. Everybody has some level of complexity that they can handle, and what you want to do is keep expanding it until you see where it breaks, and that's the role that they should stay in, that level of sophistication. But some people will surprise you. There will be people who you don't expect, with different backgrounds, without a lot of experience, that just can handle enormously complicated tasks, and so keep testing that and pushing the envelope.

这本来是不可能发生的，然而那晚他们却准时出现，冷饮被送到了正确的地方。我的第一反应很好，与冰沙无关。但好吧，现在我可以给你更重要、更琐碎、更复杂的事情去做，而这正是你每天对每个员工真正想做的事情：扩大他们的职责范围直到极限，而且确实会达到极限。每个人都有自己能处理的复杂程度，你要做的就是不断扩展，直到看到他们的极限在哪里，那就是他们应该停留的角色，那个复杂程度。但有些人会让你惊讶。有些人你意想不到，他们背景不同，经验不多，却能处理极其复杂的任务，所以要不断测试并突破极限。

The other signal to look for is once you've hired someone: with an open office, just watch who goes up to other people's desks, particularly people that they don't report to. If people start going to your desk, someone individual employee's desk and they don't report to them, it's a sign that they believe that person can help them. So if you see that consistently, those are your barrels. Just promote them, give them more opportunity as fast as you can. The other question everybody asks about people is when do you hire somebody above somebody, and when do you sort of mentor somebody or when do you need to replace somebody? The way to think about this is every company has its own growth rate and every individual has its own growth rate. So some companies that are very successful, let's say LinkedIn, LinkedIn was always a very linear company, it never went like this. For example, I joined LinkedIn 18 months after we launched and we had only 1.5 million users which in a social product is very small in number, and when I joined I was the 27th employee. When I left two and a half years later we only had 57 employees. In contrast, when I joined Square as a 20th employee, two and a half years later, we had like 250-300 employees. So each company has its own velocity on this curve, and if the company's going like this, you can only keep people in the roles that their own personal learning curve is going like this. On the other hand, if the company's growing like this, anybody whose learning curve is faster than that, you can keep giving them the same role to do. So always track the individual slope of an employee and the company's growth rate. Now you have your barrels identified, so you're picking out the people that can really take an idea that you have in the back of your head, scope it out, run with it, make it happen, ship it, and it's perfect. Where do you aim these barrels? So I'm going to argue that you really need to spend a lot of time focusing people. This is something I've learned from Peter Thiel, actually. He used to insist at PayPal that every single person could only do exactly one thing and we all rebelled. Every single person in the company rebelled to this idea because it's so unnatural, it's so different than every other company where people want to do multiple things, and especially as you get more senior you want to definitely

另一个需要留意的信号是：当你雇佣某人后，在开放式办公室里观察谁会主动走到别人的工位旁，特别是那些他们不需要汇报的对象。如果有人开始走向你的工位或某个员工的工位，而他们之间并无汇报关系，这表明他们相信那个人能够提供帮助。如果你持续观察到这种现象，这些人就是你的"核心人才"。立即提拔他们，尽快给予更多机会。关于人员的另一个常见问题是：何时需要在某人之上雇佣更高级别的人员？何时应该指导培养某人？何时需要替换某人？思考这个问题的方式是：每家公司都有其独特的增长速度，每个人也都有其独特的发展速度。以非常成功的公司为例，比如领英。领英始终保持着线性发展模式，从未出现过剧烈波动。例如，我在领英推出18个月后加入，当时仅有150万用户，这对社交产品而言规模很小。我加入时是第27名员工，两年半后我离开时，公司也只有57名员工。相比之下，我作为第20名员工加入Square时，两年半后员工数量就达到了250-300人。因此每家公司在这条曲线上都有自己的发展速度。如果公司发展平缓，你只能让员工留在那些与其个人学习曲线相匹配的岗位上。另一方面，如果公司快速增长，任何学习曲线超过公司发展速度的员工，你都可以让他们持续担任相同职责。所以要持续追踪员工个人的成长斜率与公司发展速度。既然你已经识别出了核心人才，也就是那些能够将你脑海中的想法具体化、推进执行、实现目标并完美交付的员工，那么你应该将这些核心人才瞄准何处？我认为你确实需要投入大量时间来聚焦人员配置。这实际上是我从彼得·蒂尔那里学到的经验。他曾在PayPal坚持要求每个人只能专注于一项具体工作，当时我们都对此表示反对。公司里每个人都反对这个想法，因为这太不自然了，与其他公司截然不同——在那些公司里人们希望承担多项职责，特别是随着资历加深，你肯定希望

and especially as you get more senior you want to definitely

You want to do multiple things, and you feel insulted to be asked to do just one thing. Peter would enforce this pretty strictly. He'd basically say I will not talk to you about anything else except this one thing I've assigned to you. I don't want to hear about how great you're doing over here. He would run away and then focus until you conquer this one problem. The insight behind this is that most people will solve problems that they understand how to solve. Roughly speaking, they will solve B plus problems instead of A plus problems. A plus problems are high impact problems for your company, but they're difficult. You don't wake up in the morning with a solution, so you tend to procrastinate them. So imagine you wake up in the morning, you create a list of things to do today. There's usually the A plus one at the top of the list but you never get around to it, and so you solve the second and third. Over an entire company of hundreds of people that just cascades. So you have a company that's always solving B plus things, which does mean you grow and does mean you add value. But you never really create that breakthrough idea because no one is spending 100% of their time banging their head against the wall every day until they solve it. So I highly recommend some version of that. You can be less stringent. You can have three things to work on, but I would still track at least the concept of what would happen if you only gave everybody one thing to prioritize.

你想要同时处理多项任务，当被要求只做一件事时，你会感到被冒犯。彼得会非常严格地执行这一原则。他基本上会说，除了我分配给你的这个任务，我不会和你讨论任何其他事情。我不想听你在其他方面做得多出色。他会离开然后专注工作，直到你攻克这个难题。这背后的洞见是，大多数人会解决他们知道如何解决的问题。粗略来说，他们解决的是B+级问题而非A+级问题。A+级问题是对公司具有高影响力的问题，但它们很困难。你不会在早上醒来时就拥有解决方案，因此往往会拖延这些问题。想象一下，你早上醒来，列出了今天要做的事情清单。通常A+级任务会排在首位，但你始终无法着手处理，于是你转而解决第二和第三项任务。在整个拥有数百人的公司中，这种情况会不断蔓延。最终你得到的是一家始终在解决B+级问题的公司，这确实意味着你在成长和增值。但你永远无法真正实现突破性创新，因为没有人每天花费100%的时间坚持不懈地解决问题直到成功。因此我强烈推荐采用这种方法的某种版本。你可以不那么严格，可以同时处理三项任务，但我仍然会关注这个核心理念：如果只让每个人优先处理一项任务，会产生怎样的效果。

Now, because you can't make decisions, you don't want to be making all these decisions yourself, you have to create tools that enable people to make decisions at the same level ideally of fidelity that you would make them yourself. So how do you create scale and leverage? First thing I'd recommend is building a dashboard. This is an old square dashboard. It actually looks pretty presentable even today. The construct of a dashboard, first of all, should be drafted by a founder. You need to basically simplify the value proposition in the company's metrics for success on a whiteboard. You can have other people build the dashboard, I don't actually care about that, but you need to draw it out. Like what does business success look to us and what are the key inputs to those, and then have someone create something that is very intuitive for every single person in the company including customer support to use. And then, the key metric of whether you've succeeded is what fraction of your employees use that dashboard every day. If it's actually useful it should be close to 100%. It's not going to be probably 100%, but you want to measure that. Just like you have quality scores for all your other KPIs with users, the dashboard needs to be as intuitive as your product is for users.

既然你无法做出所有决策，你也不应该独自做出所有这些决策，你必须创建工具，使人们能够在与你亲自决策时相同的理想保真度水平上做出决策。那么如何实现规模和杠杆效应？我建议的第一件事是建立一个仪表板。这是一个老式的方形仪表板。即使在今天看起来也相当体面。仪表板的构建首先应该由创始人起草。你需要在白板上基本简化公司成功指标中的价值主张。你可以让其他人来构建仪表板，我其实不在乎这一点，但你需要把它画出来。比如业务成功对我们意味着什么，实现这些成功的关键输入因素是什么，然后让某人创建一个对公司每个人（包括客户支持人员）都非常直观易用的工具。然后，衡量你是否成功的关键指标是你的员工每天使用该仪表板的比例。如果它确实有用，这个比例应该接近100%。可能不会达到100%，但你需要衡量这一点。就像你为用户的所有其他KPI设有质量评分一样，仪表板需要像你的产品对用户那样直观。

Other things, wait, hold on. Metrics are the first step. So everybody in your company absolutely should have access to every single thing that's going on. Other things that I like to do are take your board decks, and as you get more formal, the board decks will get more complicated, and actually review every single slide with every single employee after the board meeting. You can strip out the compensation information if you really want to. But every other slide you should go through with the entire employee base and explain it. And if you can remember some of the feedback you got from your board that's really cool to pass on. Another thing we did at Square, as your company skills, everybody's not going to get invited to every meeting, but they want to go to every meeting. The way you scale that is you create notes for every meeting and you send it to the entire company. So we created a notes at alias for every single meeting involving more than two people, someone would write notes and send it to the entire company. So people felt like as the company added employees, they could continue to monitor and track what was interesting, what was going on, and they never felt excluded, hopefully. The other thing is like even the details around conference rooms. Every conference room at Square has glass walls, because as soon as you have regular walls, people wonder what's going on. It's amazing, like if they can see who's actually in the meeting, and who's meeting with who and when. They don't worry nearly as much as what's going on behind those closed doors.

其他事项，等等，稍等一下。指标是第一步。因此，公司里的每个人都应该完全了解正在发生的每一件事。我喜欢做的其他事情是拿董事会演示文稿，随着公司变得更加正规化，董事会演示文稿会变得更加复杂，实际上在董事会会议后与每位员工一起审阅每一张幻灯片。如果你真的想的话，可以去掉薪酬信息。但其他每一张幻灯片都应该与全体员工一起过一遍并加以解释。如果你能记住董事会的一些反馈意见，传达给员工会非常好。我们在Square做的另一件事是，随着公司规模的扩大，不是每个人都会被邀请参加每个会议，但他们想参加每个会议。解决这个问题的方法是为每个会议创建纪要，并发送给整个公司。因此我们为每个涉及两人以上的会议创建了纪要别名，有人会撰写会议纪要并发送给整个公司。这样随着公司增加员工，人们觉得他们可以继续关注和追踪有趣的事情和正在发生的事情，希望他们永远不会感到被排斥。另一件事甚至是关于会议室的细节。Square的每个会议室都有玻璃墙，因为一旦使用普通墙壁，人们就会想知道里面在发生什么。这很神奇，如果他们能看到实际谁在开会，谁在什么时候与谁会面。他们就不会那么担心那些紧闭的门后发生了什么。

A little bit of transparency and Stripe, you may have seen a blog post, but I think Patrick wrote it, about email transparency, about actually allowing everybody to have access to email. That's pretty far out there but it's actually got interesting, you know, certain merits to it. I would all call the tactics that you read about here about as sort of minimal viable transparency. I actually think you could push the envelope a lot more. Steve Jobs tried this at Next. He actually tried transparent compensation. I actually think, although Next didn't do extremely well, the real reason wasn't because of the experiment around compensation transparency and then there's a lot of error to that. The critique of compensation transparency is often well. We want people to be teammates and work together and collaborate. And if you look in the sports world, though, where people are actually teammates and they do have to collaborate, all of their compensation is completely public. In fact, each of us can look up anybody's compensation in the sports world and get it exactly accurate, and somehow it seems to work. So I'm not totally bought in to the idea that you need to keep compensation non transparent. Then finally metrics. So you want to measure things. You want to measure outputs, not inputs. And again, you should dictate this yourself. You should draft the dashboard to tie this all together. One important concept are what are known as pairing metrics or pairing indicators, which is if you measure one thing and only one thing. The company tends to optimize to that, and often at the expense of something else that's important.

关于透明度和Stripe，你可能看过一篇博客文章，但我认为是Patrick写的，关于邮件透明度，关于实际允许每个人都能访问邮件。这听起来相当激进，但实际上它确实具有一些有趣的优点。我会把这里读到的策略称为最小可行透明度。我实际上认为你可以更进一步推动这个界限。史蒂夫·乔布斯在Next公司尝试过这个。他实际上尝试了透明薪酬。我确实认为，尽管Next公司表现不是特别好，但真正原因并不是因为薪酬透明度的实验，而且这其中存在很多误解。对薪酬透明度的批评通常很有道理。我们希望人们成为队友，一起工作并协作。然而，如果你看看体育界，人们实际上是队友，他们确实必须协作，但他们的所有薪酬都是完全公开的。事实上，我们每个人都可以查询体育界任何人的薪酬，并且能得到完全准确的信息，而这种方式似乎行得通。所以我并不完全认同需要保持薪酬不透明的观点。最后是衡量指标。你想要衡量事物。你应该衡量产出，而不是投入。再次强调，你应该自己决定这一点。你应该设计仪表板来将所有内容整合在一起。一个重要的概念是所谓的配对指标或配对指示器，即如果你只衡量一件事。公司往往会优化这一点，但通常是以牺牲其他重要事物为代价。

A costly example in payments and financial service is around risk. It's really easy to give the risk team an objective and say, we want to lower our fraud rate. It sounds great. Until they start treating every single user in this audience as a suspect user because they want to lower their fraud rate. So they require each of you to call them up on the phone and give them more supplemental information and fax in things and you have the lowest fraud rate in the world, you also have the worst customer satisfaction score. So what you want to measure at the same time as your fraud rate is your false positive rate. That forces the team to actually innovate.

支付和金融服务领域一个代价高昂的例子涉及风险管理。给风险团队设定目标并说"我们想要降低欺诈率"非常简单。这听起来很棒。直到他们开始将目标受众中的每个用户都视为可疑用户，因为他们想要降低欺诈率。于是他们要求每个人都打电话给他们，提供更多补充信息并传真材料，这样你虽然拥有全球最低的欺诈率，但同时也会得到最差的客户满意度评分。因此，在衡量欺诈率的同时，你还需要衡量误报率。这能迫使团队真正进行创新。

Similarly, you can give recruiters metrics around hiring, and guess what? You'll have a lot of people come in through interviews, but if you're not tracking the quality of hires, you may be very unhappy with the quality of people you're interviewing or the people you're giving offers to. So, you always want to create the opposite as an indication and measure both, and the people that are responsible for that team need to be measured for both.

同样地，你可以给招聘人员设定招聘相关的指标，但结果如何？会有很多人来参加面试，但如果你不跟踪招聘质量，你可能会对面试者或收到录用通知的人员质量非常不满意。因此，你总是需要设立相反的指标作为参考，同时衡量两者，负责该团队的人员也需要在这两方面都接受考核。

Finally around metrics, one insight I've had over my career is what you want to look for the anomalies. You don't actually want to look for the expected behavior. A famous example was at PayPal. None of the top ten markets that the company was planning to go after included eBay. But one day, someone noticed that 54 Power Sellers had actually handwritten into their eBay listings, please pay me with PayPal, and brought this to the attention of the executive team at the time.

最后关于指标，我在职业生涯中获得的一个洞见是，你需要寻找异常情况。你实际上并不需要寻找预期行为。一个著名的例子发生在PayPal。公司计划攻占的前十大市场中并不包括eBay。但有一天，有人注意到54个顶级卖家实际上在他们的eBay商品列表中手写注明"请用PayPal付款"，并将这一发现提请当时的高管团队注意。

The first reaction of the executive team was, what the hell's going on? Let's kick them out of the system. That's not our focus. Fortunately, I think David Sacks came back the next day and said, I think we found our market. Let's actually build tools for these power sellers instead of forcing them to write into their listing, pay me with PayPal. Why don't we have an HTML button that they can just insert? Well that started to work. And then he said, well actually why do we make them insert it. Why should we make them insert it all the time? Why don't we just automatically insert it for them? So they could just insert it once and then every single listing they have forever. It'll just automagically appear there. So that became the success for PayPal.

管理团队的第一反应是，这到底是怎么回事？让我们把他们踢出系统。那不是我们的重点。幸运的是，我认为David Sacks第二天回来说，我想我们找到了我们的市场。让我们为这些强力卖家构建工具，而不是强迫他们在商品列表中写入"用PayPal付款"。为什么我们不提供一个他们可以直接插入的HTML按钮呢？这个方法开始奏效了。然后他说，实际上我们为什么要让他们插入呢？为什么我们要让他们一直插入呢？我们为什么不直接为他们自动插入呢？这样他们只需要插入一次，然后他们所有的商品列表都会自动显示。它就会神奇地出现在那里。这就是PayPal的成功之道。

Similarly, I was at LinkedIn, and I saw this stat that made no sense to me. The UI for the site was a little bit different back then, but 25% of all clicks, maybe 30% of all clicks from the home page were people going to their own profile. And that made no sense whatsoever. I mean, it was a settings link where you had to literally go to the right margin to find it, and it was 25 to 30% of every single click at scale. This is statistically novel stuff, and it made no sense whatsoever. I had never seen a UI perform that way. I went around for weeks trying to figure this out, and then someone very smart, actually Max Letchin, said something to me. He said it's vanity, and I realized people are looking at themselves in the mirror. That's a pretty good answer. They weren't editing their profile, because nobody has something to edit every day in their profile. But they were actually just looking at themselves in the mirror every day because it made them feel good. Then you can actually test that hypothesis and say, well, if I had more content, do I look at myself in the mirror more often? Turns out you did. If you had more endorsements, did you look at yourself in the mirror more often? Turns out you did. So we actually figured out that underneath the utilitarian product the product team thought they were building was actually a lot of emotional vanity. They didn't exactly translate it to the best possible feature, like the PayPal example, where you couldn't easily put a button that said "be more vain today" on the homepage. That would probably not work perfectly, so it never really took off the way the PayPal example did. But it clarified what the users of the product really wanted, and we wouldn't have found that without looking for anomalous data.

同样地，我在LinkedIn时看到一个让我无法理解的统计数据。当时网站的界面有些不同，但从首页点击中有25%，甚至可能30%是用户访问自己的个人资料。这完全说不通。我的意思是，那是一个设置链接，你需要到右边栏才能找到，而这个链接却占了所有点击量的25%到30%。这在统计上是前所未见的，完全不合逻辑。我从未见过用户界面有这样的表现。我花了数周时间试图找出原因，然后一位很聪明的人，实际上是Max Letchin，对我说了一句话。他说这是虚荣心，我顿时明白人们是在照镜子。这是个相当好的答案。他们不是在编辑个人资料，因为没人每天都有需要编辑的内容。但他们确实每天都在照镜子，因为这让他们感觉良好。然后你可以验证这个假设：如果我拥有更多内容，我会更频繁地照镜子吗？事实证明确实如此。如果你获得更多认可，你会更频繁地照镜子吗？事实证明确实如此。所以我们最终发现，产品团队以为他们在构建的实用产品背后，实际上隐藏着大量的情感虚荣。他们并没有将其转化为最佳功能，就像PayPal的例子那样，你不可能在首页放一个写着"今天更虚荣一点"的按钮。这可能不会很有效，所以它从未像PayPal案例那样成功。但这明确了产品用户真正想要的是什么，而如果不寻找异常数据，我们就不可能发现这一点。

The final topic I want to talk about is details. The example he talks about in the book that really resonated with me was he took over the 49ers in 1979. They were the worst team in football. I believe they were 2 and 14 the year before, which is really bad if you don't know football. In the next ten years, he managed to transform the team into the NFL's best, won three Super Bowls. And what's the first thing he did to start going from a terrible team to the best team ever in many ways? He actually taught the receptionists how to answer the phone properly. He wrote a three-page memo about how to actually answer the phone. Now, that may sound absurd. But his point was, if the organization as a whole does everything exactly the right way, then receivers, for example, will start running their routes at seven-and-a-half yards, not seven yards, not eight yards. And that actually will matter. And then everybody on the team executes exactly up to the same standard of performance. You will have an organization that is performing at the highest possible level, and then with enough random variation, the highest possible performance team will do the best. So the way you translate this to a company are a lot of details that may not matter. They may not seem that they matter superficially. Most people would agree about the details matter when it faces the user. But where the real debate is on things that don't face the user. So Steve Jobs famously in the Mac, insisted on an immaculate circuit design board. You can read about this in various books. The Mac, for those of you who don't remember the Mac, probably everybody here but

我想讨论的最后一个主题是细节。他在书中提到的那个真正引起我共鸣的例子是他在1979年接管了49人队。当时他们是橄榄球界最差的球队。我相信他们前一年的战绩是2胜14负，如果你不了解橄榄球的话，这确实很糟糕。在接下来的十年里，他成功地将这支球队转变为NFL最佳，赢得了三次超级碗。那么他是如何开始将一支糟糕的球队转变为在很多方面都堪称史上最佳的球队呢？他实际上教接待员如何正确地接听电话。他写了一份三页的备忘录，详细说明了如何接听电话。这听起来可能很荒谬。但他的观点是，如果整个组织都以完全正确的方式做每件事，那么举例来说，接球手就会开始在七码半处跑动路线，而不是七码或八码。而这实际上会产生影响。然后团队中的每个人都会按照相同的绩效标准精确执行。你将拥有一个以最高水平运作的组织，在足够的随机变化下，表现最佳的团队将取得最好的成绩。因此，将这一点应用到公司中，就是关注许多可能看似不重要的细节。表面上它们可能看起来不重要。大多数人都同意面向用户的细节很重要。但真正的争议在于那些不面向用户的事情。所以史蒂夫·乔布斯在Mac电脑上 famously 坚持要求完美的电路设计板。你可以在各种书籍中读到这一点。对于那些不记得Mac电脑的人，可能这里的每个人都

The Mac, for those of you who don't remember the Mac, probably everybody here but

Some of you may have seen it, but it actually couldn't be opened. So the circuit board design couldn't be seen by any single person in the world. There was no way to open the Mac except the people who worked at Apple, and Steve insisted that it be absolutely perfect and beautiful. That's the kind of detail obsession that this sort of philosophy of building a company requires.

你们中有些人可能见过它，但实际上它无法被打开。因此世界上没有任何人能看到电路板的设计。除了苹果公司的工作人员外，没有人能够打开Mac电脑，而史蒂夫坚持要求它必须绝对完美和美观。这正是这种公司建设哲学所需要的那种对细节的执着。

Examples that maybe more practical for you instead of circuit boards are things like what food do you serve people. This actually matters more than you might guess. When people don't like the food you serve them, what do they do? They go gossip. They go complain to their friends. They go walk over to someone's desk. And all the sudden at lunch, what they're complaining about is, they're mostly spending time gossiping and complaining instead of brainstorming.

比电路板更实用的例子可能是你为人们提供什么食物。这实际上比你想象的要重要得多。当人们不喜欢你提供的食物时，他们会做什么？他们会去闲聊。他们会向朋友抱怨。他们会走到别人的办公桌前。突然之间在午餐时间，他们抱怨的是，他们大部分时间都在闲聊和抱怨，而不是进行头脑风暴。

So you don't have this serendipitous idea. Not saying other serendipitous idea that creates a spark, instead they're all wandering and wallowing around. So the best thing you could do is actually give people the food they want or food that's good for them. That makes them more productive.

因此你就不会有这种偶然的灵感。不是说其他能创造火花的偶然想法，而是他们都在四处游荡和沉溺。所以你能做的最好的事情就是给人们他们想要的食物或对他们有益的食物。这能让他们更有效率。

So it may seem a lot like this glorious job that you thought you had is actually more like running around being a task rabbit for people. But it's to take the things off the plate that are a distraction, so that they can be high-performance machines. And if you take enough things away from people that distract them and give them the tools to be successful, all of a sudden your organization produces a lot more.

所以这可能看起来很像你以为拥有的那份光荣工作，实际上更像是四处奔波为人们做杂务。但这是为了把那些分散注意力的东西从他们的盘子里拿走，这样他们才能成为高性能的机器。如果你从人们那里拿走足够多的分散注意力的东西，并给他们成功的工具，突然间你的组织就能产出更多。

Similarly, another example that's often got wrong is office space. So, one natural instinct is when you need an office to have an office manager or someone on your team go out and find offices. They'll go on tours with agents and come back with photos and ideas. You need to do that yourself. The office environment that people live in and work in everyday dictates your culture and how people make decisions. It dictates how hard people work. There's almost no more important decision other than what company you're going to be, than what's the office environment you're actually in, and most people don't do that. And then the final thing is around effort. Ultimately, I don't believe that you can build a company without a lot of effort and that you need to lead by example. So Bill Wallace, the first chapter of his books, gets asked this question of how did you know whether you're doing your job? And this is the answer he gives coaches that used to ask him that question: So if this is what you feel like every day, you're probably on the right track. And if that doesn't sound appetizing, you probably shouldn't start a company, truthfully. All right, with that I'm done with the prepared part. Let me see if anybody has questions I can try to be helpful with. Any questions? Yes?

同样，另一个经常被搞错的例子是办公空间。所以，一个自然的直觉是当你需要办公室时，让办公室经理或团队中的某个人出去找办公室。他们会和中介一起参观，带着照片和想法回来。你需要亲自做这件事。人们每天生活和工作的办公环境决定了你的文化以及人们如何做决策。它决定了人们工作的努力程度。除了你要成为什么样的公司之外，最重要的决定莫过于你实际所处的办公环境，而大多数人都不这么做。最后一点是关于努力。最终，我不相信你可以不付出大量努力就能建立一家公司，而且你需要以身作则。所以比尔·华莱士在他的书的第一章中被问到这个问题：你怎么知道你是否在做你的工作？这是他给那些曾经问他这个问题的教练们的答案：所以如果你每天都有这种感觉，你可能走对了路。如果这听起来不吸引人，说实话，你可能不应该创办公司。好的，我的准备部分到此结束。让我看看是否有人有问题我可以试着帮忙解答。有问题吗？请说？

I would probably do it in bands. You could either have everybody in the company get paid the same, or you could do it by discipline like all engineers, or by experience. The way Steve did it at Next was there was a high band and a low band. You either had a lot of experience or low experience, and that was it. The low band back then would probably be like $85,000 now, where everybody just flatly gets paid $85,000. If you're super experienced, everybody gets paid like $130,000. That's just how the Next system translated for inflation.

我可能会采用分级制。你可以让公司里的每个人都拿相同的工资，或者按专业领域划分（比如所有工程师），或者按经验划分。史蒂夫在Next公司采用的方法是设置高等级和低等级。你要么经验丰富，要么经验不足，仅此而已。当时的低等级现在可能相当于85,000美元，每个人都统一获得85,000美元的薪酬。如果你经验非常丰富，每个人都能获得约130,000美元的薪酬。这就是Next系统经通货膨胀调整后的情况。

You'd be amazed. The question was besides food, what other kind of details do people care about? The laptops they use. I mean, this is now the default that everybody has. But five years ago, it was a benefit to give people high-quality machines as opposed to optimizing our costs and having Dell machines and ugly monitors, just as an example. So if you think about all these people that are relentlessly resourceful and incredibly talented in a massively competitive ecosystem competing for talent, you want to give the people the best possible tools to do the best possible job.

你会感到惊讶。问题是除了食物之外，人们还在意哪些细节？他们使用的笔记本电脑。我的意思是，现在这已经成为每个人的标配。但五年前，为员工提供高质量设备是一种福利，而不是优化我们的成本，使用戴尔电脑和丑陋的显示器，这只是一个例子。所以如果你考虑到这些在激烈竞争的人才生态系统中不懈创新、才华横溢的人们，你会希望为他们提供最好的工具来完成最好的工作。

So you should rigorously think through how to make people more successful. What things do they not need to be working on that are distracting? And what things can I actually give them that make them more valuable per day? Then just break that down every day and solve that stuff yourself.

因此你应该严格思考如何让人们更成功。哪些分散注意力的工作是他们不需要处理的？实际上我能提供什么让他们每天更有价值？然后只需每天分解这些问题并亲自解决它们。

So when you're in a start-up environment, how do you optimize for those things? It's a good question. I actually think that you should start.

那么当你在创业环境中时，如何优化这些事情？这是个很好的问题。我实际上认为你应该开始。

First of all, you must have your own office. I don't believe ever in shared office spaces. Peter talks a little bit about this, that every start-up, every good start-up is a cult. It's really hard to create a cult if you're sharing space with people. Because a cult means that you think that you're better than everybody else in the world, that you have a special way of doing things that's different than everybody else in the world. And if you're sharing physical space with people, it's very hard to inculcate that. So, I would start there, but it is a prioritization question. When you have, everybody is going to have scarce resources, just a question of magnitude like how many zeros are you paying attention to? You know, probably not $10 expenditures, put $100, then $1,000, then 10,000, then a million, and then 10 million. Starts being a rounding error. So, what I would do is figure out like, what's most important? And in a high quality office, that creates a good vibe. That allows you to recruit people, because recruits are very savvy about this. They walk into your office, and they can tell a lot about the culture instantly. I sometimes walk into a company office and I can tell, often, whether I'm going to invest, as soon as I walk in. Like, I can absolutely rule things out that I just don't want to invest in as soon as I walk in. And there's times walking into the office is like, wow, this is very impressive. You can tell how people worked together, how hard they're working, how distracted they are. Roelof Botha at Sequoia made a point to me about YouTube. So, when I invested in YouTube,

首先，你必须拥有自己的办公室。我从不相信共享办公空间。彼得曾谈到这一点，每个初创公司，每个优秀的初创公司都像一个邪教组织。如果你与他人共享空间，就很难创建一个邪教组织。因为邪教意味着你认为自己比世界上其他人都优秀，你拥有与世界上其他人不同的特殊做事方式。如果你与他人共享物理空间，就很难灌输这种理念。所以，我会从这里开始，但这其实是一个优先级问题。每个人都会面临资源稀缺的情况，这只是一个数量级的问题——你在关注多少个零？可能不是10美元的开支，而是100美元，然后1000美元，接着1万美元，然后100万美元，再到1000万美元。最终这会变成四舍五入的误差。所以，我会做的是找出什么是最重要的？一个高质量的办公室能营造良好的氛围。这能让你招募人才，因为应聘者对此非常敏锐。他们走进你的办公室，立刻就能感受到很多关于企业文化的信息。有时我走进一家公司的办公室，经常能立即判断出是否要投资。就像我走进门就能立即排除那些我根本不想投资的项目。有时走进办公室会让人感叹，哇，这令人印象深刻。你可以看出人们如何协作，他们工作有多努力，他们分心的程度如何。红杉资本的Roelof Botha曾就YouTube向我提出一个观点。所以，当我投资YouTube时，

In the very beginning, it wasn't obviously going to be successful. Roelof led this series A investment for Sequoia in YouTube. We were at a board meeting together and he said he thinks YouTube is really going to work. When I asked why, he said every time he goes to one of his portfolio companies, half the office is watching YouTube at lunch. That was a pretty good sign. If you pick up on these little things, you can predict a lot.

在最开始的时候，YouTube显然不会成功。Roelof为红杉资本主导了YouTube的A轮投资。我们在一起开董事会时，他说他认为YouTube真的会成功。当我问为什么时，他说每次他去投资组合公司，午餐时间半个办公室的人都在看YouTube。这是个相当好的迹象。如果你能注意到这些小细节，你就能预测很多事情。

Because resources are scarce, they can learn things and you can learn management techniques later. This is better than promoting people who are just good at managing people but lack the discipline and skill, which demoralizes others. So I think being excellent at something, and then becoming excellent at getting a group of people to do something is the next task. However, some things you have to learn by doing. You can't learn to play the guitar by reading a book. You actually have to try managing a bit, and you won't do it well at first. I had another set of tactics and classes on what you actually do when transitioning from an individual contributor to a manager. It's hard. One of the first things people don't get right is their time allocation. So I would recommend doing what I call a calendar audit and tracking for a month what you spend your time on, how much is managing and editing, how much is writing, etc., and then optimize it over time. You can get a mentor, find somebody who's been a manager before that will work with you, not your boss. Because your boss has a set of complicated objectives, including how much we're shipping. A mentor can just focus on you and making you more successful.

因为资源有限，他们可以学习东西，你也可以稍后学习管理技巧。这比提拔那些只擅长管理但缺乏纪律和技能的人更好，那样会打击他人士气。所以我认为先在某方面做到优秀，然后学会带领一群人完成任务是下一步目标。然而，有些事情你必须通过实践来学习。你不能通过阅读书籍来学会弹吉他。你实际上必须尝试管理一些事务，而且一开始不会做得很好。我准备了另一套策略和课程，关于当你从个人贡献者转变为管理者时实际要做的事情。这很困难。人们最初做不好的事情之一就是时间分配。所以我建议进行我称之为日历审计的方法，跟踪一个月内你把时间花在什么地方，多少用于管理和编辑，多少用于写作等等，然后逐步优化。你可以找一位导师，找一个曾经担任过管理者的人来指导你，而不是你的老板。因为你的老板有一套复杂的目标，包括我们的产出量。导师可以只关注你，让你更成功。

But people, you just have to learn the same quality as your conversion funnel. I look at customer support, another classic area that isn't up to the same quality, and treat customer support like a product. So that you actually have an engineering team and a design team over time, that actually focuses on making that world-class. Usually, where you have different executives at a scaled company, most executives were trained differently at different companies, and they bring some of that with them. So you've got to cross train that. So, if you've hired a VP of Engineering from Google, it's very different than a design leader who came from Apple. They don't actually learn how to do anything the same way. So you're going to have to stitch that together somehow, either one or the other is going to have to learn in the other style or you're going to have to create your own style and really teach that to your executives. So it shows up all the time, but all you do, all you need to do is just pick up the company's products and look for things that have a different voice. And you can see it. Visual voice, word choice, all over the map.

但是人们必须明白，你需要让所有环节都达到与转化漏斗相同的质量标准。我关注客户支持这个典型的薄弱环节，将客户支持视为一个产品来对待。这样你就能逐渐组建起工程团队和设计团队，专注于将其打造成世界级水平。通常，在规模化公司中，不同高管来自不同公司，接受过不同的培训，他们会带来各自的经验。因此你需要进行交叉培训。如果你从谷歌聘请了工程副总裁，这与来自苹果的设计负责人会有很大不同。他们做事的方式完全不同。所以你必须以某种方式将其整合，要么让一方学习另一方的风格，要么创建自己的风格并真正教会你的高管们。这种情况随时都会出现，你只需要拿起公司的产品，寻找那些风格不一致的地方。你能够发现这些问题——视觉风格、用词选择，处处可见差异。

That actually derives from the concept of a one on one every week, so that the direct reports can fit enough one on ones in your calendar and still get other things done. So I think one on ones per week are a good idea. The agenda should be crafted by the employee who reports to the manager, not the manager. The one on one is mostly for the benefit of the employee, so they should walk in with three or four things they want to talk about. Ideally, they circulate that in advance by email, even as bullet points. But in advance you have time to chew on it and you're not on the fly, winging your responses. That's probably the best structure. Now if someone's really good and really talented and has been doing something for a long time with a lot of internal credibility, you might push out the one every week and relax that to one every two weeks, possibly once a month. I don't know that I would go beyond once a month ever.

这实际上源于每周一对一会议的概念，这样直接下属可以在你的日程中安排足够的一对一会面，同时还能完成其他工作。因此我认为每周进行一次一对一会议是个好主意。议程应该由向经理汇报的员工制定，而不是经理。一对一会议主要是为了员工的利益，所以他们应该带着想要讨论的三四个议题来参加。理想情况下，他们应该提前通过电子邮件分发这些议题，甚至可以是简单的要点。但提前准备让你有时间仔细思考，而不是临时仓促应对。这可能是最佳结构。如果某人非常优秀且才华出众，长期从事某项工作并具有很高的内部可信度，你可以将每周一次的会议延长至每两周一次，甚至可能每月一次。我认为不应该超过每月一次的频率。

It's just going to stack and frustrate people. So, it's really now different disciplines. Engineering, I actually think roughly one to ten to 20 is probably about the right range. You don't need more engineers until you have more barrels. Designers are a little different, but it's always going to be hiring more ammunitions. A good leader, a good barrel will kind of have a feel for that. So one way to correct for this natural tendency is to increase your headcount on your team, like sort of an empire building tendency. Like, oh so I manage 20 people, and Sam only manages ten, and you manage three. So, I'm more important than Sam and you're more important than you. One way to do that is you put an X here of the number of people that the output, specify how many things they've done successfully then divide by the number of people on their team, and tell them that this is going to be their grade in their performance review. Shockingly this doesn't start increasing on that team. It's amazing how this works. And be really explicit about it.

这只会不断堆积并让人感到沮丧。所以，现在确实是不同的学科。工程方面，我实际上认为大约1到10到20人可能是合适的范围。在拥有更多核心人员之前，你不需要更多的工程师。设计师有些不同，但总是需要雇佣更多的执行人员。一个好的领导者，一个好的核心人员会对此有所感觉。所以纠正这种自然倾向的一种方法是增加团队人数，就像某种帝国建设倾向。比如，我管理20个人，而山姆只管理10个，你管理3个。所以，我比山姆更重要，你比你更重要。一种做法是，在这里标注X表示产出人数，具体说明他们成功完成了多少事情，然后除以团队人数，并告诉他们这将是他们绩效评估的等级。令人惊讶的是，这并不会让团队开始增加人数。这种方法的效果真是令人惊叹。并且要非常明确地说明这一点。

Are you the no priority? Then about 25% is probably a pretty good allocation. Actually I like the calendar audit for CEO's even more than for new managers. So when I work with CEO's sometimes who aren't thriving in that role for the first time, I actually forced them to show me their calendar. And before I do that, I asked them to write their priorities down on a piece of paper and discuss whatever they are. Then we go pull up their calendar and see if it matches. And it never matches. Recruiting is the one that's most often awry. Let's say half the CEO's you meet with will say recruiting's the number one priority. It's almost never the biggest block of time on anybody's calendar. So that's what you're trying to do is match resources and inputs against priorities. A calendar audit unfortunately there's no software that does this really well. It would be great. We literally pull up someone's Google calendar and manually add up the hours, which is somewhat insane. But that's the best way. What are your priorities? If your priorities are raising money, you don't want to allocate 100% of your time for recruiting. You want to allocate a fair amount of time to raising money for that block of time until you're successful at it.

你是否没有优先级？那么大约25%可能是一个相当不错的分配比例。实际上，比起新经理，我更喜欢对CEO进行日程审计。当我与那些初次担任此职却未能胜任的CEO合作时，我实际上会强制他们向我展示他们的日程安排。在此之前，我会要求他们写下自己的优先事项，记录在纸上，并讨论这些事项的具体内容。然后我们调出他们的日程表，看看是否匹配。而它们从不匹配。招聘是最常出问题的环节。假设你接触的CEO中有一半会说招聘是第一要务。但这几乎从来不是任何人日程表上最大的时间块。所以你试图做的就是将资源和投入与优先事项相匹配。遗憾的是，目前没有软件能很好地完成日程审计。这本来会很棒。我们实际上会调出某人的谷歌日历，手动累加时间，这有点疯狂。但这是最好的方法。你的优先事项是什么？如果你的优先事项是融资，你就不应该把100%的时间都分配给招聘。你应该为融资分配合理的时间，直到在这方面取得成功。

They never do things, but then you said it's good to write a few page script for your receptors. Focus on all the details. How do you harmonize those goals? It's a good question. I think the way to harmonize is really about how you harmonize things where details can really matter, but you only get one thing to do and you've gotta allocate to the top one, two, or three things. How do you put those two things together? And actually there is some tension in, even in a healthy organization, there's some tension of like why are we actually focused on writing the script as opposed to something a user may see. I think the underlying philosophy of getting the details right is pretty important to install in the very beginning of a company because people will start acting that way and making decisions that way themselves. So, you won't have to actually literally do that. And if you have to do that, it actually shows you that the foundation isn't actually that solid. So when you first start the company, it's about getting the details right, that everybody is precise, everybody on every task is always thinking that way. And then that scales, and then the people you bring in, it's a little self-fulfilling, people who can think that way will tend to get hired, people who can't won't get hired. Each team, and each leader, will tend to enforce that themselves, to see who's almost never doing it. So, it's partially about how you start, and in cultures like that, the key to culture is it's a rule. It's a framework for making decisions.

他们从不做事，但后来你说为你的接收器写几页脚本是件好事。专注于所有细节。你如何协调这些目标？这是个好问题。我认为协调的方式实际上是如何在细节确实重要的情况下协调事物，但你只能做一件事，必须分配给最重要的一两件事。你如何将这两件事结合起来？实际上存在一些紧张关系，即使在一个健康的组织中，也存在一些紧张关系，比如为什么我们实际上专注于编写脚本，而不是用户可能看到的东西。我认为在公司的起步阶段就树立注重细节的基本理念非常重要，因为人们会开始以这种方式行动并自行做出决策。这样你就不必实际去做这件事。如果你必须这样做，实际上表明基础并不那么牢固。所以当你刚开始创办公司时，关键在于确保细节正确，每个人都精确，每个任务的每个人都始终以这种方式思考。然后这种模式会扩展，你引进的人也会自我实现，能够以这种方式思考的人往往会被聘用，不能的人则不会被聘用。每个团队和每个领导者都会倾向于自行执行这一点，看看谁几乎从不这样做。所以，这在一定程度上是关于你如何开始，在那种文化中，文化的关键在于它是一个规则。它是一个决策的框架。

They never learn how to make decisions across that culture. You never say anything except just watch, promote, and move people around. Cool, well I guess that's it, thank you.

他们从未学会如何跨越那种文化做出决策。你除了观望、推动和调动人员外，从不发表意见。好的，我想就这样吧，谢谢。
