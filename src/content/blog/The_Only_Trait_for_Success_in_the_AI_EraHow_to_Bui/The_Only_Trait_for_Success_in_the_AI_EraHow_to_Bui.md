Soon after Chat GPT came out, I started traveling around the country telling people, "Oh no, there's this new thing people are going to need to learn to be more creative because that's the only thing that the AI can't do." I don't say that anymore because now I've seen that the AI can actually come up with lots and lots of ideas. Last year, the International Math Olympiad problems, four of them were solved by Google's artificial intelligence. The International Math Olympiad has six questions and all six of the questions are very very original. They are so original that when the national coaches meet, they all look at the problems and they all try to make sure nothing too similar to those problems has ever appeared in any contest or anywhere in the world before. The questions are supposed to be really original.

在Chat GPT问世后不久，我开始周游全国告诉人们："哦不，人们需要学习这个新事物来变得更有创造力，因为这是AI唯一做不到的事情。"我现在不再这么说了，因为我看到AI实际上能够提出很多很多想法。去年，国际数学奥林匹克竞赛的题目中有四道被谷歌的人工智能解决了。国际数学奥林匹克竞赛有六道题目，所有六道题目都非常具有原创性。这些题目如此具有原创性，以至于当国家队教练们开会时，他们都会仔细研究这些题目，确保在世界任何竞赛或任何地方都没有出现过与之过于相似的问题。这些题目本就应该非常具有原创性。

But nevertheless, the artificial intelligence was able to come up with solutions to four out of six, which is more than I can do. The creativity in the AI can probably surpass what we can do, too. The only unique thing about human intelligence is that we hopefully care that humans still exist. I'm Po Shanlow. I'm a mathematician who likes to solve real world problems. In real life, I'm a math professor at Carnegie Melon University, but I'm also a social entrepreneur where I've been running my own educational solution, which tries to make the world a more thoughtful place.

然而，人工智能能够为六个问题中的四个提出解决方案，这比我所能做到的还要多。人工智能的创造力很可能也超越了我们所能达到的水平。人类智能唯一独特之处在于，我们仍然希望关心人类的存在。我是Po Shanlow。我是一名喜欢解决现实世界问题的数学家。在现实生活中，我是卡内基梅隆大学的数学教授，但我也是一名社会企业家，一直在运营自己的教育解决方案，试图让世界变得更加深思熟虑。

One of the biggest places where students are using AI to cheat on their homework is for their writing. This unfortunately could make a huge problem for human civilization because you just have to think what is that AI anyway? It's a large language model. How is that AI so good? It's because it's good at language. It's good at looking at the patterns of words that often appear. If many kids lose this ability, we'll get many kids who grow up and aren't able to think logically. All they're able to do is just take whatever anyone else gives them. They'll just be dependent. If you're already grown up and you already have that skill and you're using the AI to achieve that task because that's for your job, great. Okay, you're using it to do a job. But if you're in school, why are you doing that writing? It's not because the writing you make is going to make money directly. No, no, that writing is actually part of your own learning. Using AI to do your writing homework in school is like saying, "I'm not going to run a mile for exercise. I'm going to drive my car.

学生使用人工智能作弊的最大领域之一就是写作作业。这可能会给人类文明带来巨大问题，因为你不禁要思考，人工智能到底是什么？它是一个大型语言模型。为什么人工智能如此出色？因为它擅长语言。它擅长观察经常出现的词语模式。如果许多孩子失去这种能力，我们将会有很多长大后无法进行逻辑思考的孩子。他们只会接受别人给他们的任何东西。他们只会变得依赖他人。如果你已经长大并且已经具备这种技能，并且因为工作需要而使用人工智能来完成那个任务，那很好。你是在用它来完成工作。但如果你还在上学，为什么要做那些写作练习？不是因为你的写作能直接赚钱。不，不，那些写作实际上是你自己学习的一部分。在学校使用人工智能来完成写作作业就像在说："我不会为了锻炼而跑一英里。我要开车"。

I'm going to drive my car one mile for exercise. How much exercise you get? You get none. You're going to grow up and you're not going to be able to be as physically fit. Similar thing here with mentally fit. And just this observation that the power of the large language model is the L, the language. That's why we need to really make sure that all of our kids, if any, and if you're watching this and you're students, this is why you need to be really, really good with language for the next generation. All of these skills like reading and writing, communication, logic, these are all going to be very important because these are how you develop a good way to think. I was explaining to people the reason why we do this math is not because eventually we have to do algebra, but the reason is because eventually this just.

我要开车一英里作为锻炼。你能得到多少锻炼？一点都没有。你长大后将无法保持身体健康。心智健康也是类似的情况。这个观察表明，大型语言模型的力量在于L，即语言。这就是为什么我们需要确保所有的孩子，如果有的话，以及正在观看这个视频的学生们，都需要为下一代真正精通语言。阅读、写作、沟通、逻辑等所有这些技能都将非常重要，因为这些是培养良好思维方式的方法。我向人们解释说，我们学习数学的原因不是因为最终要做代数，而是因为最终这仅仅。

I was explaining to people the reason why we do this math is not because eventually we have to do algebra, but the reason is because eventually this just makes you smarter. So you're able to go and think through situations you haven't seen before and figure them out. I interview lots and lots of high school students who want to work with me. And during the interview, the way that I interview for intelligence is I ask them questions, usually math questions because those are analytical. And I ask them questions until it's very clear from their body language that they have never seen this question before. Because usually if you're doing math questions and you've seen it before, you have a certain look of confidence in your eyes. But I wait until it's really clear that they have never seen this before. And then I want to see how you think. Actually, because you've never seen that question before, the expectation is that you won't solve it. And so then I start to give hints.

我向人们解释我们学习数学的原因，并不是因为我们最终必须使用代数，而是因为这最终会让你变得更聪明。这样你就能够思考从未遇到过的情况并找到解决方法。我面试了很多想和我一起工作的高中生。在面试过程中，我测试智力的方式是向他们提问，通常是数学问题，因为这些问题需要分析能力。我会一直提问，直到从他们的肢体语言中明显看出他们从未见过这个问题。因为通常如果你在做数学题并且以前见过它，你的眼神会流露出某种自信。但我会等到非常确定他们从未见过这个问题。然后我想看看你是如何思考的。实际上，因为你从未见过那个问题，预期是你无法解决它。于是我开始给出提示。

Those hints are usually ideas that they wouldn't have encountered before in school. And then I want to see how quickly can you synthesize these new hints, these new ways of thinking, synthesize them into a solution for a problem we have never seen before. Actually, that's also creativity. So that's one particular piece. But going forward, I think that one of the skills that people will really need is that aspect of actually wanting to create value and delight in other people. Why do I say this? I say this because for many, many years, humans were the top species, the most capable things on this planet. Soon it will not be that case. Soon, you're going to have to work together to survive.

这些提示通常都是他们在学校里从未接触过的想法。然后我想看看你能多快地将这些新提示、这些新的思维方式综合运用，为前所未见的问题找到解决方案。实际上，这也是一种创造力。这只是其中一个方面。但展望未来，我认为人们真正需要的技能之一，就是那种真心实意为他人创造价值和带来愉悦的特质。为什么这么说？因为千百年来，人类一直是地球上的顶级物种，最具能力的生物。但很快这种情况就会改变。很快，你们必须通过合作才能生存。

The only way to get other people to want to team up with you is for you to authentically and deeply be a person who is motivated by creating value in the other. If you are not that way, you are a bad partner and people will not want to go and team with you. If they don't team with you, you will die. You will lose opportunity because eventually all of these kinds of jobs you can use AIS to do. Then why would anyone want to employ you? Why would anyone want to have you as someone on their team? Presumably only because they somehow felt like you are going to create some value and they like that vibe. They like you. I think what we really need is to get more and more people who are figuring out what the real problem to solve is. But unfortunately sometimes when kids just think about problems, they don't realize that the way that you solve a problem is through empathy and through relating to

让别人愿意与你合作的唯一方式，就是你要真正成为一个发自内心为他人创造价值的人。如果你不是这样的人，你就是个糟糕的合作伙伴，人们不会愿意与你共事。如果他们不与你合作，你将面临淘汰。你会失去机会，因为最终这类工作都可以通过人工智能系统来完成。那么为什么还有人愿意雇用你？为什么还有人愿意让你加入他们的团队？大概只是因为他们觉得你能创造某种价值，并且喜欢这种氛围。他们喜欢你。我认为我们真正需要的是让越来越多的人去发现真正需要解决的问题是什么。但不幸的是，有时候当孩子们思考问题时，他们没有意识到解决问题的方式是通过同理心和建立联系

But unfortunately sometimes when kids just think about problems, they don't realize that the way that you solve a problem is through empathy and through relating to other people. Why? Because you can't solve a problem unless you can visualize it through their eyes. I do spend a significant amount of my life working towards the goal of being better at simulating the world. I also use AI for that. I think I'll give one exact example. I was just in Nashville, Tennessee last week and I just saw a really I thought very very talented singer in one of the bars there. Wow, she's good. And I just got curious, how hard is it to be able to get a performing spot on Broadway in Nashville. So I asked AI and I was actually not just interested in AI tell me about it. I want to see the links, you know, tell me more. What is the background of this particular place here she's performing at? Right.

但不幸的是，有时候当孩子们只考虑问题时，他们没有意识到解决问题的方法是通过同理心和与他人建立联系。为什么？因为除非你能通过他人的视角来看待问题，否则你无法解决它。我确实花了大量时间致力于更好地模拟这个世界。我也使用人工智能来实现这个目标。我想举一个具体的例子。我上周在田纳西州纳什维尔，在一家酒吧里看到了一位我认为非常有才华的歌手。哇，她真棒。我开始好奇，在纳什维尔的百老汇获得演出机会有多难。于是我询问了人工智能，实际上我不仅仅满足于让AI告诉我答案。我想看到相关链接，了解更多信息。她表演的这个特定地方有什么背景？没错。

I will make my own conclusions based on knowing. Oh, I see. So there's all of these different people who would want to do this thing, right? So if you're one of the people who got picked to do it at this prime time, this makes logical sense. See, I'm using the AI to build the logic inside my brain for understanding country music performance. And why was I trying to understand? Honestly, it's because these days I also work with professional entertainers. So, I'm also myself always scouting. The big heart of this is I wasn't using the AI to write the report for me. I was using AI to make myself better at that particular goal. Being able to simulate the world is the superpower that makes someone able to be a successful entrepreneur. Simulating the world allows you to imagine a product or imagine a strategy.

我会基于认知得出自己的结论。哦，我明白了。原来有这么多不同类型的人都想参与这件事，对吧？如果你是被选中在黄金时段参与的人之一，这在逻辑上是说得通的。看，我正在利用AI在我大脑中构建理解乡村音乐表演的逻辑框架。我为什么要尝试理解呢？说实话，是因为最近我也与专业演艺人员合作。所以我自己也一直在物色人才。关键在于我并非使用AI来替我撰写报告，而是利用AI来提升自己实现特定目标的能力。能够模拟世界是让人成为成功企业家的超能力。模拟世界让你能够构想一个产品或设想一项策略。

And then play it forward in your head. What would happen if I did this? A long time ago when I started with education, I was actually just thinking about how to help people do math problems. Today when I think back to that time, I think I was probably a solution looking for a problem in the sense that uh somehow I thought it would be very important for people to be good at math. But then things that happened later in my life as I became the national coach of the US Olympic math team, I saw situations where there were so many so clever, so capable people who were still so depressed. And furthermore, after they graduated from high school, they even didn't really know what to do next because they thought that the point of life was to find ways to prove you're better than other people.

然后在脑海中预演一下。如果我这样做会发生什么？很久以前当我刚开始从事教育工作时，我其实只是在思考如何帮助人们解决数学问题。如今回想那段时光，我觉得自己可能是个在寻找问题的解决方案——某种程度上我认为人们擅长数学非常重要。但后来当我成为美国数学奥林匹克国家队教练时，我目睹了许多聪明能干的人依然深感抑郁的情形。更甚的是，他们高中毕业后甚至不知道接下来该做什么，因为他们认为人生的意义就在于找到证明自己比别人更优秀的方法。

That's when I realized we actually will do much better if we think about the philosophy to start with, right? The philosophy in life should not be how do I outdo everyone else? If you do that, you will probably never be satisfied. But if your philosophy in life is, hey, it is actually addictive to make a bunch of other people happy. Oh, now I can do it for five people. Oh, now I can do it for 500 people. Oh, wow. Now I can get thousand people to come to this thing. The more that you do, the more you want to do. And the fun part is that correlates also with traditional success. Then I realized, ah, I should be trying to push this worldwide. And if I don't do it, who will?

就在那时我意识到，如果我们从一开始就思考人生哲学，实际上会做得更好，对吧？人生哲学不应该是如何超越其他人？如果你那样做，你可能永远不会满足。但如果你的人生哲学是，嘿，让一群人开心其实会上瘾。哦，现在我能为五个人做到。哦，现在我能为五百个人做到。哦，哇。现在我能让上千人来参加这个活动。你做得越多，就越想继续做。有趣的是，这也与传统意义上的成功相关联。然后我意识到，啊，我应该努力把这个理念推向全世界。如果我不做，谁会做呢？

With the things I've done in my life, I now have an opportunity to go and say, you know, I've seen what happens if you go all the way in pure competition. I've seen what happens if you go all the way and just practice problems to do the best on tests. Actually, that's not the right target. And I realized that because of my background, I would be able to shift mindsets. Then I said, okay, this is what I have to do. I am a math professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The way I teach every single one of my classes is that I just go up to the chalkboard with a piece of chalk and I write today we're going to do this but I forgot exactly how to do this. So I need all of you to suggest ideas and then the whole class experience becomes one where the students are suggesting ideas and I'm giving them feedback on their ideas.

回顾我人生中的经历，现在我有机会站出来说：我已经见识过纯粹竞争到底会带来什么结果。我已经见识过一味刷题追求考试高分会导致什么后果。实际上，这不是正确的目标。我意识到凭借我的背景，我能够转变人们的思维方式。于是我说，好的，这就是我必须做的事。我是卡内基梅隆大学的数学教授。我每堂课的教学方式就是拿着一支粉笔走到黑板前，写下今天我们要学习的内容，但我忘了具体该怎么进行。所以我需要你们所有人提出想法，然后整个课堂体验就变成了学生提出想法，我给予反馈的过程。

And what I've been working on as a social entrepreneur to make it possible for everybody to be able to experience education in this way is we run an online program. It's called Live. We found a way to scale up the education of critical thinking. You see the limiting factor is to have enough coaches to lead all of this critical thinking and brainstorming. And we scale it up by making a win-win situation by just observing that one of the greatest ages to learn critical thinking is when you're 10 to 13 years old. And it turns out that some of the best people to lead 10 to 13-year-old kids into the joy of being thoughtful are high school kids who are about 15 to 18 years old.

作为一名社会企业家，我一直在努力让每个人都能以这种方式体验教育，我们运营了一个在线项目。它叫做Live。我们找到了扩大批判性思维教育规模的方法。关键限制因素在于要有足够的教练来引导所有这些批判性思维和头脑风暴。我们通过创造双赢局面来扩大规模，只需观察到学习批判性思维的最佳年龄之一是10到13岁。事实证明，引导10到13岁孩子体验思考乐趣的最佳人选是15到18岁的高中生。

But what I observed is that there were plenty of kids who were 15 to 18 years old who were already very clever academically, especially in math. Their limiting factor in life eventually was not going to be their science, technology, engineering or math. It would be communication skills, confidence, and the ability to win over anybody and lead a team. So, I created a program where we find kind and mathematically clever high schoolers. And then I hire professional comedians and actors to teach them how to be charismatic and how to be able to win over anybody because if you can convince anybody to love math, you can convince anybody to do anything. And so this exchange, they're trained by the actors. They coach math. While they're coaching math, we pay for an actor to watch them for every hour that they're coaching math. The actor gives them real-time feedback to help them become more enthusiastic, emphatic, and a more winning personality. Win-win situation.

但我观察到，有很多15到18岁的孩子已经在学术上非常聪明，尤其是在数学方面。他们人生中最终的限制因素不会是他们的科学、技术、工程或数学能力，而是沟通技巧、自信心以及赢得他人支持和领导团队的能力。因此，我创建了一个项目，寻找善良且数学优秀的高中生。然后我聘请专业喜剧演员和演员来教他们如何展现魅力，如何赢得任何人的支持——因为如果你能说服任何人爱上数学，你就能说服任何人做任何事。通过这样的交流，他们接受演员的训练。他们辅导数学。在辅导数学的同时，我们付费请演员观察他们辅导的每一小时。演员会给予实时反馈，帮助他们变得更加热情、富有同理心，并塑造更具吸引力的个性。这是双赢的局面。

Now, the high schoolers directly benefit, their life becomes much better. In return, they're producing all of these critical thinking classes for kids all around the country. The architecture of this is that it just connects people. We are introducing kind and thoughtful high school students to middle school students to help them see, hey, you could become these great people who are having fun and also having a very fulfilling life. But also the way we execute the whole thing, the high schoolers all teach in pairs that not only makes the experience more fun for the people who are learning math, but it makes it so that these kind and really mathematically clever people get to know each other.

现在，高中生们直接受益，他们的生活变得更好。作为回报，他们为全国各地的孩子们制作所有这些批判性思维课程。这种架构的本质在于连接人们。我们将友善体贴的高中生介绍给初中生，帮助他们认识到，你也可以成为这些既享受乐趣又拥有充实生活的优秀人士。而且我们的执行方式也很特别，高中生们都是结对教学，这不仅让学习数学的人体验更有趣，也让这些友善且数学天赋出众的年轻人能够相互了解。

Because I don't know what kind of challenges we're going to face in the future. I think they're going to be quite big and technology will make it so that whatever the challenges we face are, they're big. So, we also need to have a big network of kind people who are clever, who know each other, and who have trust so that if there are some civilization threatening challenges that arise, well, then maybe there will be some people who will stand up, work together, and do something about it. This is what I pay attention to as I travel around the entire country and the world. I'm actually thinking about the robustness of human society. Whether or not if there was some challenge that faced the world due to technology, are we as human civilization equipped to rise up and face that challenge? To me, it all starts from thoughtfulness. The work I do is really focused on building up autonomous human thinking. That's why the core word I use for the philosophy is thoughtful.

因为我不知道我们未来将面临什么样的挑战。我认为这些挑战会相当巨大，而技术会让无论我们面对什么挑战都变得重大。因此，我们还需要建立一个由善良、聪明、相互认识且彼此信任的人组成的大型网络，这样如果出现某些威胁文明的挑战，也许就会有人站出来，共同努力并采取行动。这就是我周游全国和世界时关注的重点。我实际上在思考人类社会的韧性。如果技术给世界带来某种挑战，我们人类文明是否准备好挺身而出面对这一挑战？对我来说，这一切都始于深思熟虑。我的工作真正专注于培养人类的自主思考能力。这就是为什么我哲学体系的核心词汇是"深思熟虑"。

I've watched over many years as people are becoming less and less interested in thinking. I think that actually happened because people found out that they can entertain themselves with iPads and this unfortunately makes people also not have as much interest in concentrating and thinking about something. AI could make that much worse. The fun part of life is having your own contribution to the life that you live. Actually, I think that's why people actually like creativity. It's fun. People like to draw. People like to put their own flavor. People like to wear their own fashion.

多年来我观察到人们对思考越来越不感兴趣。我认为这实际上是因为人们发现可以用iPad自娱自乐，这不幸地使人们对专注和思考某事的兴趣也减少了。人工智能可能会让这种情况变得更糟。生活的乐趣在于为你所过的生活做出自己的贡献。实际上，我认为这就是为什么人们真正喜欢创造力的原因。这很有趣。人们喜欢画画。人们喜欢加入自己的风格。人们喜欢穿自己的时尚服饰。

It expresses yourself. This expression of yourself would be lost if everything you do is efficient but just reliant on the AI which told you how to dress today. That's why I want more and more people to discover it's fun to think. It's fun to have your own twist on things, your own idea that you inject inside. The other dangerous thing that happens if people lose the ability to think and reason is that it makes it far easier to deceive people. The world is so complicated that if you look at any situation in the world, sometimes depending on how you tell the story of what happened, you can say statements that are all true which make you come up with a different feeling. I think it's really important for people to be critical and for people to be able to understand what's really going on because sometimes when someone's talking to you, they have an agenda. Like I'll be frank, I have an agenda. I'm trying to build a more thoughtful world and I'm going to be very upfront with you on that.

它表达你自己。如果你做的每件事都很高效，但仅仅依赖告诉你今天穿什么的AI，这种自我表达就会消失。这就是为什么我希望越来越多的人发现思考的乐趣。在事物中加入自己的独特见解、注入自己的想法是很有趣的。如果人们失去思考和推理能力，另一个危险是这会让人更容易受骗。世界如此复杂，如果你观察世界上任何情况，有时根据你讲述事情经过的方式，你可以说出全部真实的陈述，却让人产生不同的感受。我认为人们保持批判性思维、能够理解真正发生的事情非常重要，因为有时别人和你交谈时是带有目的的。坦白说，我也有目的。我正在努力建设一个更具思考性的世界，我会非常坦诚地告诉你这一点。

Anyone who's watching this video, I think it's really important that we have as many people as possible find out how much fun it is to delight other people and to have the ability to think and figure that out. That's my agenda. But you see, everyone has an agenda. And if you can't think for yourself and you just listen to some authority, what if that agenda is actually to your detriment? You'll have no way of knowing. The technology revolution really made all of us start to realize how much of an impact bias has in the sense that whoever makes some technology tool has some bias. What does bias really mean? Well, I guess as a mathematician, the way I would say it is 2 plus two is always four. That's right. What's the point of life? Oh, I don't know. Like, there's no clear definition. What's the point of life? I think the point of life is

观看这个视频的每个人，我认为非常重要的一点是让尽可能多的人发现取悦他人以及拥有思考和解决问题的能力是多么有趣。这就是我的目标。但你看，每个人都有各自的意图。如果你不能独立思考，只是听从某些权威，万一那个意图实际上对你有害呢？你将无从得知。技术革命确实让我们所有人都开始意识到偏见的影响有多大，因为任何制造技术工具的人都带有某种偏见。偏见到底意味着什么？作为一个数学家，我想说的是2加2总是等于4。这是正确的。生命的意义是什么？哦，我不知道。就像没有明确的定义。生命的意义是什么？我认为生命的意义是

I think the point of life is to delight as many other people as you can, but I know that you might not necessarily agree, and it's not a problem. I think it's healthy that we may have different starting points. The part that becomes unhealthy is where there is only a very short menu of options each of which is followed by a huge number of people. That's actually where bias comes in because we just mentioned so far in this video a couple of different sources of AI providers. We have Claude, we have OpenAI, there's also Gemini. If you're in China, there's Deepseek. There are all of these, but that's relatively few. If you think about it, that would be sort of like saying, well, the world has lots of different viewpoints. It has five of them. Really? No. No.

我认为人生的意义在于尽可能让更多人感到快乐，但我知道你可能不一定同意，这也没关系。我认为我们有不同的出发点是很健康的。不健康的地方在于只有非常有限的选择菜单，而每个选择都有大量的人追随。这实际上就是偏见产生的地方，因为我们刚才在这个视频中提到了几个不同的人工智能提供商。我们有Claude，我们有OpenAI，还有Gemini。如果你在中国，还有Deepseek。虽然有这些选择，但相对还是很少。仔细想想，这就像是说世界上有很多不同的观点，但只有五种。真的吗？不，不是这样的。

The world has seven and a half billion different viewpoints. There are seven billion people. One of the beautiful things about humanity is the fact that there are so many different ideas all out there. Let's be frank, some of the ideas are bad. Some people are unfortunately in prison because they decided to kill someone else. Hopefully we all understand that this is a bad idea. The point is there are lots of different people who are trying different kinds of ideas, lots of different philosophies. In this great big marketplace of ideas that is the world, we see some ideas come out and the variety also allows us to have more creativity perhaps. When I look at the different AI tools, it's actually well known that they have certain biases.

世界拥有七十五亿种不同的观点。地球上有七十亿人口。人性的美好之处在于存在着如此多元的思想。坦率地说，有些想法是糟糕的。有些人因为决定杀害他人而不幸入狱。希望我们都能理解这是种错误的行为。关键在于有众多不同的人正在尝试各种理念和哲学思想。在这个如同巨型思想市场的世界里，我们看到某些理念脱颖而出，而这种多样性或许也能让我们拥有更多创造力。当我观察各种人工智能工具时，众所周知它们确实存在某些偏见。

This is also why for me when I try to get the news, I don't only go to CNN.com. I also go to Fox News. I tune my social media so that my X is all tracking Republican right-leaning viewpoints and my Facebook is all tracking left-leaning viewpoints. And I look at both of them every day because I want to see what's going on. And my expectation is yes, you're going to be biased. You have a certain view on the world and you think you're right. And you're biased, too. You have a way of thinking of the world. And my job as I simulate the world is to try to figure out where do you disagree? You disagree perhaps on a few values of how people should live their life. And then that causes you to have different ways of reporting on the story.

这也是为什么当我想要获取新闻时，我不仅会访问CNN网站，也会浏览福克斯新闻。我会调整社交媒体设置，让我的X平台全部追踪共和党右倾观点，而我的脸书则全部追踪左倾观点。我每天都会查看这两个平台，因为我想了解正在发生的事情。我的预期是，是的，你们都会有偏见。你们对世界有特定的看法，并且认为自己是对的。你们也有偏见，你们有自己看待世界的方式。而我模拟世界的任务就是试图找出你们的分歧点在哪里？你们可能在关于人们应该如何生活的某些价值观上存在分歧，这导致你们以不同的方式报道新闻。

I think it's all the more important now that there's AI out here which sounds like a very convincing reasonable person. It's even more important that people look at things and say, "All right, is that really the story?" Because I think that the AI is going to be so good at looking complete that you may think you have the entire story on a controversial situation, but you don't. I am an optimist, as you can probably tell from the way I'm talking. I'm optimistic because I can see that thoughtful people stick together. I've been working on my work with this whole group of high school students and so on for 3 years and I can just see there are so many kids who are not kids anymore who are growing up who are really clever but so kind and they also know each other. They make me optimistic about the future.

我认为现在更为重要的是，当出现听起来像非常有说服力的理性人士的人工智能时，人们更需要审视事物并问："好吧，这真的是事实吗？"因为我认为人工智能会表现得如此完整，以至于你可能以为自己掌握了争议事件的全部真相，但实际上并没有。正如你从我的谈话方式中可以看出的，我是一个乐观主义者。我之所以乐观，是因为我看到有思想的人们团结在一起。三年来我一直与这群高中生等人一起工作，我看到有那么多不再是小孩子的年轻人正在成长，他们非常聪明又善良，而且彼此了解。他们让我对未来充满希望。

Not only the ones that I work with, but the fact that if I'm working with these people, that means there are other people out there too. I'm basically seeing with my own eyes the power of what can be done if you bring together people who have in common this idea that they actually like people and they want to make the world brighter. See, one reason I'm building this whole community of really kind and clever people is because I'm also hoping to eventually build a whole lot of social entrepreneurs. Social entrepreneur is someone who makes a conscious decision to not necessarily become that rich. You're doing it for a different purpose. It's not because you want tons of money. It's because what makes you happy is seeing lots of delighted people. Social entrepreneurship is hard.

不仅是我共事的这些人，更重要的是，如果我能与这些人合作，就意味着世界上还有更多志同道合的人。我亲眼见证了当聚集起一群志趣相投、真心关爱他人并希望让世界更美好的人时，所能迸发出的力量。我建立这个由善良聪慧之人组成的社群，其中一个原因就是希望最终培养出大批社会企业家。社会企业家是那些自觉选择不追求巨额财富的人。你这么做是出于不同的目的，不是因为渴望万贯家财，而是因为看到众人欢欣鼓舞的模样最令你快乐。社会创业充满艰辛。

The hard part is that sometimes at the beginning you feel this is an important problem that needs to be solved. Why won't people pay me to do it? I need a donation or an investment or something. That's how I started off. Today when I do my social entrepreneurship, I think very carefully how much does that problem actually cost? You know that if it's a problem, there's a real cost. In fact, it should be possible to make money. That word entrepreneur hopefully also includes something about sustainability through business type form. A good social enterprise should make a net profit on every single person that they help. The problem that happens with social entrepreneurship sometimes is that people are doing something which would be nice to solve, but they haven't found a way to tie that together with solving a problem that has real monetary value that you can find someone to pay for.

困难之处在于，有时刚开始你会觉得这是个需要解决的重要问题。为什么人们不愿意付钱让我做这件事？我需要捐款或投资之类的支持。这就是我最初的经历。如今当我从事社会创业时，我会仔细思考这个问题实际造成的成本是多少。你要明白，如果它确实是个问题，就必然产生实际成本。事实上，应该有可能从中盈利。"创业者"这个词理应包含通过商业形式实现可持续性的内涵。优秀的社会企业应该能从每个帮助对象身上获得净利润。社会创业有时会出现的问题是，人们在做一些看似值得解决的事情，但未能找到将其与解决具有实际货币价值的问题相结合的方法，即找到愿意为此付费的对象。

You should hopefully be able to figure out how it costs the world something that the problem is there. Aha. Now try to figure out who is paying that cost right now and see if maybe they would be interested in paying you for you to go and solve that problem. You just have to go and hunt around how can I figure out how the positive that's created on average is spread apart across everyone who is playing and then you also get a little bit too. That's actually what we do. For example, we provide all this education since we make the best after school math classes for middle school students who want enrichment in the world. We have lots of customers. They pay for it. So, we have the profit. But because I'm a social entrepreneur, we subsidize students from different parts of the country and different parts of the world.

你应该能够想明白这个问题给世界带来了什么代价。啊哈。现在试着找出谁正在承担这个代价，看看他们是否有兴趣付钱让你去解决这个问题。你只需要四处寻找方法，弄清楚平均产生的积极影响如何分摊给每个参与者，然后你也能分得一小部分。这正是我们所做的。例如，我们提供所有这些教育服务，因为我们为想要充实自己的全球初中生提供最好的课后数学课程。我们有很多客户，他们为此付费，所以我们有利润。但由于我是一名社会企业家，我们资助来自全国和世界各地的学生。

How come nobody else ever thought of putting professional actors to live coach high school math stars who are kind while they live stream math classes to middle school kids? And that whole thing builds an ecosystem that builds a more thoughtful world that can hopefully help to sustain our human civilization. It's actually an obvious idea. There are actors. There are math people. We can all win. It took 11 years to really build up to the stage that I am right now. It took 8 years to come up with that idea. You can imagine how many other weird ideas came about along the way. Anytime I see any thing in the world or something I need to do, I try to keep coming up with a weird new way to do it. For fun, I like to constantly be thinking, is there another way? Is there another way? Is there another way?

为什么没有人想过让专业演员现场指导那些友善的高中数学明星，同时向初中生直播数学课程呢？整个事情构建了一个生态系统，创造了一个更富有思考的世界，有望帮助维持我们的人类文明。这其实是个显而易见的想法。有演员，有数学人才，我们都能受益。我花了11年才真正达到现在的阶段，用了8年才想出那个主意。你可以想象在这个过程中产生了多少其他奇怪的想法。每当我看到世界上任何事物或需要做某事时，我都会尝试想出奇怪的新方法来做这件事。为了好玩，我喜欢不断思考：有没有其他方法？有没有其他方法？有没有其他方法？

When I do this most of the time I come up with a way and then the next question becomes all right what could be wrong with it. So I first generate like this I want to generate new idea and after the new ideas there I say now I want to destroy the new idea. I want to shoot it down. How could it possibly be wrong? Because 99% of the ideas that I generate that are new are fundamentally flawed. But 1% are good. You have to just be constantly for its own sake saying could there be another way of doing this? Could there be another way of doing this? So this combination of generate with excitement, destroy with lots and lots of effort and then after a while one diamond appears then push it.

当我进行这种思考时，大多数时候我会想出一个方法，然后接下来的问题就变成了：这个方法可能有什么缺陷？所以我首先会这样激发创意：我想要产生新想法，当新想法出现后，我会说现在我要摧毁这个新想法。我要把它击垮。它可能错在哪里？因为我提出的新想法中有99%都存在根本性缺陷。但还有1%是优秀的。你必须持续不断地自问：这件事是否还有其他实现方式？是否还有其他实现途径？这种充满激情的创意生成，加上不遗余力的批判否定，经过一段时间后，那颗钻石般的想法就会浮现，这时就要全力推进它。
