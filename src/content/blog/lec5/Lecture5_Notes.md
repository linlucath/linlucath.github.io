# 商业战略与竞争

Good afternoon. Today's speaker is Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders Fund. As an investor in numerous Silicon Valley tech companies, he will discuss strategy and competition. Thank you for joining us, Peter.

下午好。今天的演讲者是彼得·蒂尔，他是 PayPal、Palantir 和 Founders Fund 的创始人。作为硅谷众多科技公司的投资者，他将与我们分享关于战略与竞争的独到见解。彼得，欢迎您的到来。

Awesome. Thank you, Sam. I appreciate the invitation. I have one core principle that I'm deeply passionate about in business: when starting a company as a founder or entrepreneur, you should always strive for monopoly and avoid competition. In essence, competition is for losers—a concept we'll explore today.

太好了。谢谢萨姆，很高兴受到邀请。在商业领域，我深信一个核心原则：作为创始人或企业家创办公司时，应当始终追求垄断地位并避免竞争。从本质上讲，竞争是失败者的游戏——这正是我们今天要深入探讨的概念。

## 商业中的价值创造

I'd like to begin by addressing how to create value when starting a company. What makes a business valuable? I propose a simple formula: a valuable company must satisfy two conditions. First, it creates X dollars of value for the world. Second, it captures Y percentage of X. The key insight often overlooked is that X and Y are independent variables. X could be enormous while Y is minuscule, or X could be moderate while Y is significant.

我想首先探讨创办公司时如何创造价值。什么才是企业价值的根本所在？我提出一个简单的公式：有价值的企业必须满足两个条件。第一，为世界创造 X 美元的价值；第二，能够获取其中 Y% 的价值份额。关键在于一个常被忽视的洞察：X 和 Y 是相互独立的变量。X 可能巨大而 Y 微不足道，也可能 X 适中而 Y 相当可观。

To build a valuable enterprise, one must not only create something meaningful but also capture a portion of the generated value. Consider the contrast between the U.S. airline industry and Google's search business. By revenue metrics, airlines appear more significant—recording \$195 billion in domestic revenue during 2012 compared to Google's \$50 billion. Intuitively, most people would prioritize air travel over search engines if forced to choose. Globally, the airline industry's scale further dwarfs search engines.

要建立一家有价值的企业，不仅要创造有意义的产品或服务，更要能够捕获所产生价值的相当份额。让我们对比一下美国航空业与谷歌搜索业务。从营收规模来看，航空业似乎更胜一筹——2012年国内营收高达1950亿美元，而谷歌仅为500亿美元。从直觉上讲，如果必须二选一，大多数人会认为航空出行比搜索引擎更加重要。从全球视角来看，航空业的规模更是远超搜索引擎行业。

但航空业的盈利能力却惨淡得多。2012年整个行业仅实现微薄盈利，回顾其百年发展历程，美国航空公司的累计利润几乎为零。航空公司往往在短期盈利后陷入破产，经过资本重组后又重蹈覆辙。这种现象在市值上体现得淋漓尽致：整个美国航空业的市值仅相当于谷歌的四分之一。这说明，规模相对较小的搜索引擎业务实际创造的价值远超航空业，深刻揭示了不同行业在价值创造与价值获取方面的本质差异。

### 完全竞争与垄断的二元格局

In economics, perfect competition presents both advantages and drawbacks. As taught in introductory courses, this model is mathematically tractable and theoretically efficient in static environments—allocating consumer surplus across society. Politically, competition is often portrayed as socially beneficial. However, participants in hyper-competitive markets rarely sustain profits, as we'll explore later.

因此，我认为商业世界存在两种截然不同的形态：一端是完全竞争的行业，另一端则是垄断企业。垄断企业通常拥有更强的稳定性和资本积累能力，特别是那些通过创新形成的"创造性垄断"，往往代表着真正的价值创造。这种二分法框架揭示了一个令人惊讶的事实：世界上基本只存在两种商业模式——完全竞争型与垄断型，介于二者之间的中间状态少之又少。

This dichotomy is often misunderstood because people consistently misrepresent the nature of their businesses. In my view, this is the most critical business concept that remains widely unrecognized. There are fundamentally only two types of businesses, and the confusion stems from the deceptive narratives surrounding them.

这种二分法常常被误解，因为人们总是歪曲自己业务的本质。在我看来，这是最关键的商业概念，却仍未获得广泛认知。本质上只存在两种类型的业务，而混淆源于围绕它们的欺骗性叙述。

## 商业表现的频谱

If we imagine a spectrum ranging from perfect competition to monopoly, the apparent differences between companies seem minimal. Monopolistic enterprises deliberately downplay their dominance to avoid government scrutiny and regulation, thus never admitting their monopoly status. Conversely, businesses operating in intensely competitive environments—where profitability is challenging—tend to exaggerate their uniqueness to attract investment and differentiate themselves.

如果我们设想一个从完全竞争到垄断的频谱，企业之间的表面差异似乎微乎其微。垄断企业故意淡化其主导地位以避免政府审查和监管，因此从不承认自己的垄断地位。相反，在竞争激烈、盈利能力受限的环境中运营的企业往往夸大其独特性，以吸引投资并实现差异化。

### 市场感知的扭曲

This creates a perceptual distortion where monopolists pretend to face fierce competition, while non-monopolists claim to occupy unique market positions. Although their narratives converge superficially, the actual disparity between these business models is substantial. The deception operates in opposite directions: non-monopolists describe their market as extremely narrow, while monopolists portray theirs as exceptionally broad.

这造成了一种认知扭曲现象：垄断者刻意假装面临激烈竞争，而非垄断者却声称自己拥有独特的市场地位。尽管双方的叙述在表面上趋于相似，但这两种商业模式之间的实际差距天壤之别。这种误导性叙述呈现相反的方向：非垄断者会极力缩小市场描述的范围，而垄断者则尽量扩大其市场定义。

In set-theoretic terms, monopolists define their business as the union of diverse markets, whereas non-monopolists define it as the intersection of niches. For instance, a restaurant owner might claim to be "the only British restaurant in Palo Alto"—a rhetorical minimization of market scope. Conversely, a monopolist would emphasize participation in a broad competitive landscape.

用集合论的概念来解释，垄断者倾向于将其业务定义为多个不同市场的并集，而非垄断者则将其定义为若干利基市场的交集。比如，一个餐厅老板可能会声称自己是"帕洛阿尔托唯一的英式餐厅"——这是一种修辞策略，通过缩小市场范围来突出独特性。相反，垄断者则会强调自己身处广阔的竞争环境中。

Consider restaurants as a classic example of hyper-competitive businesses. In a perfectly competitive environment, capital accumulation becomes impossible as profits are eroded. To attract investment, entrepreneurs construct idiosyncratic narratives, such as emphasizing geographic or culinary exclusivity. However, such artificially constricted market definitions often fail to reflect reality, as customers can easily seek alternatives in neighboring areas.

以餐厅作为高度竞争业务的典型例子。在完全竞争环境中，由于利润被侵蚀，资本积累变得不可能。为吸引投资，创业者会构建独特叙事，例如强调地域或菜系的排他性。然而，这种人为限制的市场定义往往不符合现实，因为顾客可以轻松在邻近区域寻找替代选择。

### 虚假的细分市场

The concept of a market exclusively for British cuisine is practically nonexistent, as no one survives on such a restrictive diet. This represents a fictitiously narrow market. A Hollywood analogy illustrates this well: imagine a film pitch about a college football star joining elite hackers to avenge his friends by hunting a shark. While such a movie hasn't been made, the fundamental question remains whether this constitutes a valid category or merely adds to an oversaturated, hyper-competitive landscape where profitability is notoriously elusive. In Hollywood, sustained profitability through filmmaking is exceptionally challenging.

所谓专营英国菜的市场其实是虚构的，因为没有人会单纯依靠英国菜生存。这代表了一种人为构造的狭窄市场。好莱坞有一个绝佳的类比：想象一部电影的剧情是大学橄榄球明星与精英黑客联手为朋友复仇猎杀鲨鱼。虽然这样的电影从未问世，但关键问题是：这到底是一个真实有效的细分类型，还是只是为已经过度饱和、竞争激烈到盈利几乎不可能的市场增加噱头？要知道，在好莱坞通过电影制作实现可持续盈利是极其困难的。

### 概念叠加的陷阱

Startups often fall into similar traps by combining buzzwords like "sharing," "mobile," "social," and "apps" to create an appealing narrative. However, such rhetoric of intersectionality generally signals an unsustainable business model. When something claims to be unique within a specific context—like being "the Stanford of North Dakota"—it often proves to be merely "the nothing of nowhere." True differentiation requires substantive value rather than conceptual stacking.

初创企业经常掉入类似的陷阱，把"共享"、"移动"、"社交"和"应用"等热词拼接成看似诱人的商业故事。然而，这种多概念交集的修辞往往暗示着不可持续的商业模式。当某个项目声称自己在特定情境下独一无二——比如"北达科他州的斯坦福"——最终往往被证明只是"虚无之地的虚无"。真正的差异化需要的是实质性价值，而不是概念的简单堆砌。

### 垄断认知的维度转换

Consider Google's strategic positioning: despite dominating 66% of the search engine market—a monopoly stronger than Microsoft's 1990s dominance—it rarely identifies as a search company. Framed as an advertising business, Google's $17 billion search ad revenue represents just 3.5% of the global $500 billion advertising market. Alternatively, as a technology company competing in autonomous vehicles, consumer electronics, and cloud services against Apple, Facebook, and Amazon, it appears as one player in a trillion-dollar arena rather than a monopolistic entity.

以谷歌的战略定位为例：尽管它占据了搜索引擎市场66%的份额——这一垄断地位甚至超过了微软在1990年代的巅峰时期——但它很少将自己定义为一家搜索公司。如果将其归类为广告公司，谷歌170亿美元的搜索广告收入在全球5000亿美元的广告市场中仅占3.5%。而如果将其视为科技公司，它在自动驾驶、消费电子和云服务等领域与苹果、Facebook和亚马逊竞争，看起来只是万亿美元市场中的普通参与者，而非垄断企业。

# 科技行业的垄断动态

We must remain vigilant against regulatory overreach while recognizing the powerful incentives that distort market dynamics. The technology sector exemplifies concentrated markets, as evidenced by major corporations like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. These companies consistently accumulate massive cash reserves while maintaining extraordinarily high profit margins. A key factor behind the U.S. tech industry's financial success lies in its tendency to create monopoly-like business structures. This phenomenon manifests through corporations amassing such substantial capital that they eventually reach a point of not knowing how to effectively deploy it.

我们必须在警惕监管过度的同时，清醒认识到那些扭曲市场动力机制的强大利益驱动因素。科技行业完美展现了市场集中化的特征，苹果、谷歌、微软和亚马逊等巨头企业就是最好的例证。这些公司在维持极高利润率的同时，不断积累着庞大的现金储备。美国科技行业财务成功的关键在于，它们倾向于构建类垄断的商业结构。这一现象的具体表现就是：企业积累了如此巨额的资本，以至于最终都不知道该如何有效配置和运用这些资源。

## 通过市场战略建立垄断

A counterintuitive approach to establishing monopolies involves targeting small markets initially. For startups seeking market dominance, the optimal path begins with capturing an entire small market before expanding concentrically. Attempting to conquer large markets from inception typically reflects flawed category definition and inevitably leads to excessive competition. Most successful Silicon Valley companies followed this blueprint: Amazon originated as an online bookstore offering unprecedented selection, then expanded into broader e-commerce; eBay commenced with Pez dispensers before progressing to Beanie Babies and diverse auction categories.

建立垄断地位的反直觉策略在于最初瞄准小型市场。对于寻求市场主导地位的初创企业，最佳路径是先完全占领一个小市场，再进行同心圆式扩张。从创立之初就试图征服大市场通常意味着类别定义存在缺陷，必然导致过度竞争。大多数成功的硅谷公司都遵循这一蓝图：亚马逊最初是一家提供前所未有图书选择的在线书店，然后扩展到更广泛的电子商务领域；eBay从售卖Pez糖果盒起家，逐步发展到豆豆娃和各种拍卖品类。

## 小市场悖论

These successful ventures often began with markets so minuscule that their potential value was widely dismissed. PayPal's inception focused exclusively on approximately 20,000 eBay power sellers - a segment initially perceived as undesirable due to its association with online junk sales. This strategic focus, however, enabled concentrated market penetration. The apparent limitation of a small market ultimately became the foundation for scalable monopoly development.

这些成功的企业往往起步于规模极小、潜在价值被普遍忽视的市场。PayPal创立时专门服务于约2万名eBay大卖家——这个细分市场最初因与在线二手交易相关联而被认为缺乏吸引力。然而，正是这种战略聚焦实现了集中化的市场渗透。小市场表面上的局限性最终成为了可扩展垄断业务发展的基石。

实现 25-30%的市场渗透率能在两三个月内创造显著优势。 This approach generates organic traffic, builds brand recognition, and establishes a foundation for sustainable growth. Small markets are often undervalued despite their potential. Facebook's initial launch at Harvard exemplifies this – capturing 60% of the 10,000-person market within ten days demonstrated remarkable traction. Business schools frequently dismiss such small markets as insignificant, yet these concentrated footholds enable concentric expansion that creates immense value, as seen with PayPal and eBay's early development.

实现 25-30%的市场渗透率能在两三个月内创造显著优势。这种策略能够产生自然流量，建立品牌认知度，并为可持续增长奠定基础。小规模市场虽然潜力巨大却常被低估。Facebook 在哈佛大学的初始发布就是例证——在十天內占领万人大学生的 60%市场份额，展现出惊人的吸引力。商学院常将这类小市场视为微不足道，但正是这些集中立足点实现了同心圆式扩张，最终创造巨大价值，PayPal 和 eBay 的早期发展都印证了这一点。

清洁技术泡沫（2005-2008 年）揭示了瞄准超大市场的陷阱。大多数失败的清洁科技公司有个共同点：它们都以万亿级能源市场为切入点。然而在广阔海洋中作为小鱼生存极为困难，这意味着面临无数未知竞争对手。理想定位应当是在小生态系统中成为独一无二的存在，而非第四家在线宠物食品公司或第十家薄膜太阳能企业。即便餐饮业规模达万亿美元，作为帕罗奥图第 100 家餐厅仍难成功——大规模现有市场通常意味着激烈竞争和高度同质化。

## 垄断企业的成长路径

The most counterintuitive yet effective strategy involves targeting minuscule markets that others overlook. These overlooked niches provide footholds for expansion, enabling scalable monopoly businesses. There's no single formula for creating monopolies, but technology history shows every transformative moment is unique. The next breakthrough won't replicate Facebook's model, but will emerge from identifying new, seemingly insignificant opportunities that contain concentric growth potential.

最反直觉却有效的策略是瞄准被人忽视的微小市场。这些被忽略的利基市场为扩张提供立足点，最终形成可规模化的垄断业务。创造垄断企业虽无固定公式，但科技史表明每个变革时刻都具有独特性。下一个突破不会复制 Facebook 模式，而是源于发现蕴含同心圆增长潜力的新兴机遇。

## 科技公司的垄断特征

The next Larry Page will not build a search engine, nor will the next Bill Gates create an operating system. Simply imitating these pioneers means failing to truly learn from them. Truly unique enterprises often engage in unprecedented endeavors, which ultimately grants them the potential to achieve monopoly status. As Tolstoy wrote in Anna Karenina: "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." The reverse holds true in business. I believe all successful companies are distinct because they offer something truly unique. Conversely, all failing companies resemble one another because they cannot break free from the homogeneity of competition.

下一个拉里·佩吉不会打造搜索引擎，下一个比尔·盖茨也不会开发操作系统。单纯模仿这些先驱意味着未能真正汲取其精髓。真正独特的企业往往从事前所未有的业务，这最终使它们具备垄断的潜力。正如托尔斯泰在《安娜·卡列尼娜》中所写："所有幸福的家庭都十分相似，而每个不幸的家庭各有各的不幸。"商业世界恰恰相反。我认为所有成功的企业都独具特色，因为它们提供真正独特的产品或服务。相反，所有失败的企业都彼此相似，因为它们无法摆脱同质化竞争的泥潭。

### 专有技术优势

A key characteristic of monopoly technology companies is possessing proprietary technology. My admittedly unconventional rule of thumb is that such technology should be at least an order of magnitude superior to alternatives. Amazon offered over ten times more books through efficient online sales, while PayPal processed payments more than ten times faster than paper checks that required seven to ten days to clear. The fundamental requirement is achieving dramatic improvement—preferably by an order of magnitude—in a critical dimension. Truly groundbreaking innovations, like the iPhone as the first functional smartphone, represent near-infinite improvements that redefine entire categories.

垄断科技公司的关键特征在于拥有专有技术。我提出的虽看似随意但实用的经验法则是：技术优势需达到下一个最佳替代方案的十倍以上。亚马逊通过高效在线销售提供超过十倍数量的书籍，PayPal 的处理速度比需要七到十天清算的纸质支票快十倍以上。核心要求是在关键维度实现巨大突破——最好达到数量级提升。像 iPhone 作为首款实用智能手机这样的突破性创新，更是带来了近乎无限的改进，重新定义了整个行业。

## 网络效应与商业动态

I believe network effects often play a crucial role, as they can trigger self-reinforcing cycles that create significant value. However, these effects tend to lead to monopolies over time. The particular challenge with network effects is their initial difficulty to gain traction. While everyone recognizes their ultimate value, the fundamental question remains: why would the first participant find it worthwhile?

我认为网络效应常常发挥着关键作用，它们能够触发自我强化的循环从而创造显著价值。然而这些效应往往会随着时间形成垄断地位。网络效应的特殊挑战在于初期难以形成规模效应。尽管人们都认识到其最终价值，但根本问题始终存在：为什么首位参与者会觉得值得参与？

### 垄断企业的经济特征

Economies of scale emerge when businesses operate with high fixed costs and minimal marginal costs, which typically characterizes monopoly-like enterprises. Another factor is branding—a conceptual imprint embedded in people's consciousness. Although I never fully comprehend how branding operates and consequently avoid investing in branding-centric companies, I acknowledge it as a genuine phenomenon that creates real value.

当企业以高固定成本和极低边际成本运营时就会出现规模经济，这通常是垄断企业的特征。另一个因素是品牌效应——一种根植于人们意识中的概念印记。尽管我从未完全理解品牌运作机制因而避免投资以品牌为核心的企业，但我承认这是创造真实价值的客观现象。

Software businesses demonstrate remarkable proficiency in leveraging these economic principles, particularly economies of scale. Since the marginal cost of software is virtually zero, a successful software solution often vastly outperforms existing alternatives. This creates tremendous scaling potential where businesses can expand exponentially without proportional cost increases.

软件行业在运用这些经济原理方面表现出显著优势，尤其是规模经济效应。由于软件的边际成本几乎为零，成功的软件解决方案通常能大幅超越现有替代方案。这创造了巨大的扩展潜力，使企业能够实现指数级增长而无需相应增加成本。

# 后发优势

Even if a market starts small, businesses can grow rapidly enough to maintain their size relative to an expanding market and preserve monopoly power. The key to such monopolies is not temporary dominance but long-term sustainability. In Silicon Valley, while the "first mover" concept is popular, a more accurate perspective is to strive to become the "last mover"—the final enduring company in a category. These are the truly valuable enterprises. Microsoft remained the dominant operating system for decades, Google is the definitive search engine, and Facebook's value hinges on its potential to be the ultimate social network.

即使市场初期规模很小，企业也能快速成长，从而在扩张的市场中保持相应规模并维持垄断地位。垄断的关键不在于短暂的优势，而在于长期可持续性。在硅谷，虽然"先行者"概念很流行，但更准确的角度是努力成为"终局者"—某个领域最终存续的公司。这些才是真正有价值的企业。微软作为主导操作系统持续数十年，谷歌是决定性的搜索引擎，而脸书的价值则取决于它能否成为社交网络的终极形态。

## 长期价值创造

The value of being the last mover lies in the fact that most of a company's worth derives from future earnings. In a discounted cash flow analysis, when growth rates significantly exceed discount rates, the majority of value comes from distant future cash flows. For example, at PayPal in March 2001—after 27 months of operation with 100% annual growth and a 30% discount rate—approximately three-quarters of the company's value was attributed to cash flows from 2011 onward. This pattern holds true for most technology companies, where long-term potential constitutes the bulk of their valuation.

"终局者"的价值在于企业的大部分价值来源于未来收益。在折现现金流分析中，当增长率远高于折现率时，主要价值来自远期现金流。例如，PayPal 在 2001 年 3 月—运营 27 个月后年增长率达 100%，折现率为 30%—其约四分之三的企业价值来自于 2011 年之后的现金流。这个模式适用于大多数科技公司，长期潜力构成了它们估值的主体。

## 科技公司的价值评估维度

When analyzing technology companies in Silicon Valley—such as Apple, Twitter, Facebook, emerging internet firms, or Y-Combinator startups—the financial data reveals that 75% to 85% of their value derives from cash flows projected for 2024 and beyond. This underscores the long-term nature of valuation. In Silicon Valley, we tend to overemphasize growth rates while underestimating durability. Growth is easily quantifiable in the present, but the critical question is whether a company will remain relevant a decade from now. This longevity aspect dominates the value equation, though it involves more qualitative judgment.

在分析硅谷的科技公司时——无论是苹果、推特、脸书、新兴互联网企业还是 Y-Combinator 孵化的初创企业——财务数据表明，其 75%至 85%的价值来源于 2024 年及以后的预期现金流。这凸显了估值具有长期性特征。在硅谷，我们往往过度关注增长率，却低估了企业的持久生命力。增长率是当下可精确衡量的指标，但真正的核心问题在于公司十年后是否仍能保持竞争力。这种持续生存能力才是价值评估的主导因素，尽管其判断更依赖于定性分析。

### 垄断特性的时间维度

If we revisit the characteristics of monopolies—proprietary technology, network effects, and economies of scale—these can be viewed as attributes that enable market dominance at a specific point in time. However, their sustainability over time is equally crucial. Each characteristic has a temporal dimension: network effects strengthen as the network expands, making such businesses increasingly monopolistic. Proprietary technology requires breakthrough innovation that significantly outperforms existing solutions to capture attention, but the challenge lies in maintaining leadership without being displaced.

回顾垄断企业的特征——专有技术、网络效应和规模经济——这些可被视为在特定时段内实现市场主导的要素。但它们的持续有效性同样关键。每个特征都具有时间维度：网络效应随规模扩大而增强，使企业逐步形成更强垄断地位；专有技术需实现颠覆性创新以脱颖而出，但难点在于如何避免被后来者取代。

History shows that breakthrough innovations do not always translate into sustainable profits. Consider disk drive manufacturing in the 1980s: companies could develop superior products and temporarily dominate the market, only to be overtaken within two years. Over 15 years, consumers benefited from vastly improved technology, but most innovators failed to build lasting businesses. The key is not only to achieve technological breakthroughs but also to ensure they are defensible—either as the final significant advancement or through continuous innovation that maintains a leading edge.

历史表明，突破性创新未必能转化为持续盈利。以 1980 年代的磁盘驱动器制造业为例：企业可能开发出领先产品并短暂主导市场，但往往两年内就被取代。尽管十五年里技术进步显著惠及消费者，多数创新者却未能建立持久业务。核心在于不仅要实现技术突破，更要构建防御性——要么成为最终的重大技术革新者，要么通过持续创新保持领先优势。

### 后发优势的战略价值

A market structure with frequent innovation may benefit society but often harms individual businesses. Economies of scale reinforce incumbency advantages. The concept of "last mover" is critical: while first movers gain minor initial advantages (like white in chess having a one-third pawn edge), long-term success depends on sustaining dominance. The goal is to build structures where continued innovation prevents competitors from catching up, transforming temporary breakthroughs into enduring monopolies.

频繁创新的市场结构虽有利于社会，但通常对个体企业不利。规模经济会强化现有企业的优势。"后发优势"概念至关重要：尽管先行者可能获得微小初始优势（如国际象棋中白方多三分之一兵的优势），长期成功取决于持续主导能力。企业应构建能通过不断创新阻挡追赶者的体系，将暂时性突破转化为持久垄断。

To win the game, one must become the last mover. As world champion Capablanca demonstrated, mastering the endgame is fundamental. While not the sole focus, this approach underscores the importance of asking why a company would remain dominant in 10, 15, or 20 years—a critical perspective for strategic thinking.

成为最后的行动者才能赢得比赛。正如世界冠军卡帕布兰卡所证明的，掌握终局是根本。虽然这不是唯一的重点，但这种方法强调了思考一家公司为何能在 10 年、15 年或 20 年后保持主导地位的重要性——这是战略思维的关键视角。

### 垄断与竞争：更广泛的影响

Let me explore two additional dimensions of the monopoly versus competition framework. This concept is central to understanding business formation and innovation history. Over the past 250-300 years, we have witnessed extraordinary technological progress across domains: steam engines, railways, telephones, refrigeration, household appliances, computing, and aviation. Similarly, science has experienced centuries of groundbreaking innovation.

让我从垄断与竞争框架的两个额外维度进行探讨。这一概念对于理解企业形成和创新历史至关重要。过去 250-300 年间，我们在蒸汽机、铁路、电话、制冷、家电、计算和航空等领域见证了非凡的技术进步。同样，科学也经历了数个世纪的突破性创新。

What often goes unrecognized is that value creation and reward capture are independent variables. Many revolutionary innovations generate immense value, yet their creators frequently receive no compensation. The history of science exemplifies this pattern—scientists typically capture 0% of the value they create. They operate under the illusion of a just universe that rewards their contributions, but reality proves otherwise.

常被忽视的是，价值创造和回报获取是独立变量。许多革命性创新产生了巨大价值，但其创造者往往得不到补偿。科学史印证了这一模式——科学家通常无法获得其创造价值的任何份额。他们活在一个幻想中，认为公正的宇宙会回报其贡献，但现实却截然不同。

## 科学技术中价值获取的幻觉

Scientists in our society often labor under a fundamental delusion regarding value creation. Even within technology—a field comprising numerous specialized areas—there have been groundbreaking innovations that generated immense societal value. Yet the creators themselves frequently captured very little of that value. The entire history of science and technology can be reinterpreted through the lens of value capture, revealing entire sectors where innovators gained virtually nothing. Consider the most brilliant physicist of the 20th century: despite developing both special and general relativity, they never became millionaires, let alone billionaires. The mechanism for converting scientific achievement into personal wealth simply doesn't function that way.

在我们的社会中，科学家们常常陷入一个关于价值创造的根本性错觉。即使在包含众多专业领域的技术行业，那些产生巨大社会价值的突破性创新，其创造者往往只能获取其中极少部分价值。从价值获取的角度重新解读科技发展史，会发现整个行业领域的创新者几乎一无所获。以 20 世纪最杰出的物理学家为例：尽管提出了狭义和广义相对论，他们却从未成为百万富翁，更不用说亿万富翁。将科学成就转化为个人财富的机制根本不以这种方式运作。

### 价值消散的历史模式

The railroad industry created tremendous value yet most companies went bankrupt due to excessive competition. The Wright brothers pioneered flight but never profited significantly. These examples reveal structural patterns across industries where value capture remains elusive. Throughout the 250-year sweep of industrial history, successful value capture is exceptionally rare—the norm being zero percent returns. Scientific breakthroughs never translate directly into financial gain, while technological innovations almost never yield substantial profits. During the first Industrial Revolution (1780-1850), textile mills and steam engines drove annual efficiency improvements of 5-7% for decades. Yet by 1850, Britain's wealth remained concentrated among landowning aristocrats—neither workers nor capitalists benefited substantially, as competition dissipated all profits among hundreds of textile manufacturers.

铁路业创造了巨大价值，但大多数公司因过度竞争而破产。莱特兄弟开创了飞行时代却未获得显著利润。这些案例揭示了各行业存在的结构性模式——价值获取难以实现。纵观 250 年的工业史，成功的价值获取极为罕见，零回报才是常态。科学突破从未直接转化为财务收益，技术创新也几乎从未产生可观利润。第一次工业革命期间（1780-1850），纺织厂和蒸汽机推动效率以每年 5-7%的速度持续提升数十年。然而到 1850 年，英国财富仍集中在土地贵族手中——由于数百家纺织厂商的竞争稀释了所有利润，工人和资本家都未获得实质性收益。

### 成功价值获取的特例

Only two broad categories have consistently enabled value capture over the past 250 years. The first involves vertically integrated complex monopolies emerging from the second industrial revolution—exemplified by Ford Motor Company and Standard Oil. These enterprises required sophisticated coordination of multiple components, creating tremendous competitive advantages when properly assembled. This capital-intensive business model remains surprisingly underutilized today, partly because contemporary culture resists complex, long-term ventures. Yet when successfully executed, this approach generates exceptional value.

过去 250 年间，仅有两类模式持续实现了价值获取。第一类出现于第二次工业革命时期垂直整合的复合垄断企业，以福特汽车公司和标准石油为典范。这些企业需要多环节的精密协同，形成后产生巨大竞争优势。这种资本密集型的商业模式在当今仍未被充分应用，部分源于现代文化对复杂长期项目的抵触。然而一旦成功实施，该模式将创造非凡价值。

## 垂直整合与软件优势

Elon Musk leveraged his PayPal success to build Tesla and SpaceX. The key to these companies' achievements lies in their complex vertically integrated monopoly structures. When examining Tesla or SpaceX, one might question if there was a single breakthrough innovation. While they certainly innovated across multiple dimensions, there was no singular massive advancement in battery storage or rocketry. What truly impressed was their ability to integrate all components through vertical integration more effectively than their competitors. Tesla integrated car distributors to prevent profit loss, unlike the rest of the US auto industry. Similarly, SpaceX internalized subcontracting processes, whereas large aerospace companies rely on single-source subcontractors that charge monopoly prices, making profitability challenging for the integrators. Vertical integration represents an underexplored modality of technological progress that deserves greater attention.

埃隆·马斯克凭借在 PayPal 的成功创立了特斯拉和 SpaceX。这些公司成功的关键在于其复杂的垂直整合垄断结构。当审视特斯拉或 SpaceX 时，人们可能会质疑是否存在单一突破性创新。虽然它们在多个维度都实现了创新，但在电池存储或火箭技术领域并未出现单一重大突破。真正令人印象深刻的是它们通过垂直整合比竞争对手更有效地整合了所有组件。特斯拉整合汽车经销商以防止利润流失，这与美国汽车行业的普遍做法不同。同样，SpaceX 将分包流程内部化，而大型航空航天公司依赖单一来源的分包商，这些分包商收取垄断价格，使得整合企业难以盈利。垂直整合是一种尚未被充分探索的技术进步模式，值得更多关注。

Software itself possesses remarkable power due to its inherent characteristics. It exhibits incredible economies of scale with low marginal costs. Unlike the physical world of atoms, the digital world of bits enables rapid adoption. This fast adoption rate is critical for market capture and dominance. Even with a small market, slow adoption allows competitors sufficient time to enter and compete. Conversely, a small to mid-sized market with rapid adoption can be completely dominated. This dynamic explains Silicon Valley's success and why software has become such a phenomenal industry.

软件本身因其固有特性而具有显著优势。它展现出惊人的规模效应和低边际成本。与物理世界不同，数字世界能够实现快速普及。这种快速采用率对于市场占领和主导至关重要。即使市场规模较小，缓慢的采用速度也会给竞争者足够的进入和竞争时间。相反，具有快速采用率的中小市场规模市场可以被完全主导。这种动态解释了硅谷的成功以及软件行业为何如此非凡。

People often provide various rationalizations for why certain ventures succeed while others fail. These explanations tend to obscure the fundamental question of creating X dollars in value and capturing Y percentage of that value. The scientific community often rationalizes that scientists are not motivated by money but by charitable purposes, suggesting that financial motivation undermines scientific integrity. While not advocating for pure profit-driven motives, we should critically examine whether such rationalizations mask the reality where Y equals zero percent. Scientists often operate in environments where innovation is effectively competed away, preventing them from directly capturing any value. Conversely, the software industry's distortion arises from vast wealth creation, leading people to assume it represents the world's most valuable endeavor. If Twitter employees make billions, people may incorrectly conclude this reflects ultimate value creation.

人们经常为某些企业成功而其他企业失败提供各种合理化解释。这些解释往往模糊了创造 X 美元价值并捕获其中 Y 百分比这一根本问题。科学界常合理化说科学家不受金钱驱动而是出于慈善目的，暗示财务动机会损害科学诚信。虽然不提倡纯粹利润驱动的动机，但我们应该批判性地审视这种合理化是否掩盖了 Y 等于零的现实。科学家通常在创新被有效竞争掉的环境中工作，无法直接捕获任何价值。相反，软件行业的扭曲源于巨额财富创造，导致人们认为这代表了世界上最有价值的事业。如果推特员工赚取数十亿美元，人们可能会错误地得出结论认为这反映了终极价值创造。

## 创新与竞争的动态

It is often argued that platforms like Twitter hold far greater value than the contributions of historical figures like Einstein. However, such rationalizations tend to overlook the fundamental independence of variables X and Y. In certain industries, it is possible to capture significant amounts of X, while in others, it is not. The history of innovation consistently demonstrates that microeconomic factors and industry structures play a crucial role. There are instances where individuals amass vast fortunes by operating within industries with favorable structures, while others achieve little despite their efforts, simply because they are entrenched in highly competitive fields. Rather than dismissing these disparities, it is essential to examine them more deeply.

人们常认为，像推特这样的平台比爱因斯坦等历史人物的贡献更具价值。然而，这类合理化论述往往忽略了变量 X 和 Y 本质上的独立性。在某些行业中可以积累大量 X 资源，而在其他行业则无法实现。创新史反复证明，微观经济因素和行业结构起着决定性作用。有些人因身处结构有利的行业而积累巨额财富，而另一些人尽管付出巨大努力却收获甚微，只因他们深陷高度竞争的领域。我们不应简单回避这些差异，而应进行更深入的剖析。

### 重新思考“竞争是失败者的游戏”这一概念

Finally, let us return to the overarching theme of this discussion: the idea that "competition is for losers." This phrasing is intentionally provocative, as we typically associate losers with those who perform poorly in competitive environments—such as the slowest runners on a high school track team or students who score lower on standardized tests and fail to gain admission to top schools. We often perceive losers as individuals who lack competitive ability. However, I urge a reconsideration of this mindset. Perhaps the issue lies not with the competitors themselves, but with the nature of competition. It is possible that our intellectual understanding of the monopoly-competition dichotomy is flawed or incomplete. This misunderstanding persists partly because the reality is often misrepresented or distorted, despite the rich history of innovation that informs our perspective.

最后，让我们回归本次讨论的核心主题——“竞争是失败者的游戏”这一观点。该表述本身带有挑衅性，因为我们通常将失败者与竞争中的弱势方划等号——例如高中田径队中跑得最慢的成员，或标准化考试分数较低、未能进入顶尖学府的学生。我们常将失败者视为缺乏竞争力的人。但我呼吁重新审视这种思维定式。问题或许并不在于竞争者本身，而在于竞争的本质。我们对垄断与竞争二元对立的认知可能存在缺陷或不完整。这种误解之所以持续，部分是因为现实常被曲解或误导，尽管创新史为我们提供了丰富的参考依据。

## 竞争的心理学

Human nature rationalizes events through peculiar reasoning patterns. This represents not merely an intellectual blind spot but also a psychological one, where we demonstrate inherent attraction to various forms of competition. We find reassurance in following others' actions. The term "ape" has carried dual meanings since Shakespeare's era - referring to both primates and imitation. There exists a profoundly mimetic quality in human nature: apelike, sheeplike, lemminglike, and herdlike tendencies. This problematic characteristic requires constant critical examination and conscious overcoming.

人类天性会通过非常奇特的推理模式来合理化各种事件。这不仅是智力上的盲点，更是心理层面的盲点——我们对各种形式的竞争表现出天然的吸引力。跟随他人行为会让我们感到安心。自莎士比亚时代起，"ape"一词就具有双重含义：既指灵长类动物，也指模仿。人性中存在深刻的模仿特质：类猿性、类羊性、类旅鼠性和群体性。这种问题特性需要持续批判性审视和自觉克服。

### 竞争作为社会验证

The concept of competition often serves as a form of validation, driving us toward pursuits that attract masses. This phenomenon doesn't reflect crowd wisdom; rather, when numerous people attempt something, it frequently indicates collective irrationality rather than inherent value. Consider the 20,000 annual migrants to Los Angeles aspiring to become movie stars, with merely 20 achieving success. The Olympic framework offers slightly better efficiency, as participants can relatively quickly assess their capabilities, thereby reducing societal resource waste.

竞争常被视为一种社会认同形式，驱使人们追逐大众化目标。这种现象并非群体智慧的体现；当众人追逐同一目标时，往往证明的是集体非理性而非内在价值。例如每年有两万人前往洛杉矶追求明星梦，但成功者仅二十人左右。奥林匹克体系相对更高效，因为参与者能较快评估自身能力，从而减少社会资源浪费。

Pre-Stanford educational experiences often carry a non-competitive facade, yet most high-achievers essentially competed with overwhelming advantages - akin to bringing machine guns against bows and arrows. This creates fundamentally asymmetrical competition throughout secondary education. As advancement continues to graduate studies or postdoctoral work, questions arise regarding the rationality of intensifying competition. Henry Kissinger's observation about Harvard faculty resonates: academic battles become particularly fierce precisely because the stakes are so small.

斯坦福前的教育经历常带有非竞争性的表象，但事实上优秀者往往占据绝对优势——如同持机枪对抗弓箭手。这种根本不对称的竞争贯穿中学教育。当人们进入研究生或博士后阶段时，竞争强度是否合理值得商榷。亨利·基辛格对哈佛教师的描述颇为深刻：学术斗争之所以激烈，恰恰因为赌注太小。

## 竞争系统的心理学

On one level, this describes insanity – why would people fight so fiercely over such minor stakes? Yet it also stems from the inherent logic of competitive situations. When objective differences between individuals are minimal and differentiation becomes difficult, people feel compelled to compete ferociously to maintain distinctions that are often more perceived than real.

从某种层面看，这描绘的是一种疯狂——人们为何要为如此微小的利益拼命争斗？但这其实也源于竞争环境的内在逻辑。当个体之间的客观差异极小且难以区分时，人们会为了维持那些更多是主观感知而非真实存在的差距而展开激烈竞争。

### 恶魔岛综合征

I experienced a personal version of this during my hyper-competitive academic journey. A friend wrote in my eighth-grade yearbook: "I know you'll get into Stanford in four years." I indeed entered Stanford for law school after college, eventually joining a prestigious New York law firm. Externally, everyone aspired to join this firm; internally, everyone dreamed of leaving. This created a strange dynamic where I realized this path wasn't ideal and resigned after seven months and three days. A colleague remarked, "It's reassuring to see you leave, Peter. I had no idea escape from Alcatraz was possible." Yet all it required was walking out the front door and not returning.

这种竞争心态在我高度内卷的求学经历中得到了印证。八年级毕业纪念册上朋友写道："相信你四年后定能考入斯坦福。"我最终确实进入斯坦福法学院深造，并加入纽约一家顶级律所。外界人人向往这家律所，内部员工却都想离开。这种诡异氛围让我意识到问题所在，在七个月零三天后选择了辞职。一位同事感叹："看到你离开很欣慰，彼得。我原以为逃离恶魔岛是不可能的。"其实只需走出前门不再回头即可。

People become so invested in winning these competitions that they lose sight of what truly matters. While competition undoubtedly improves performance in specific domains by fostering comparison with peers and driving incremental improvements, this advancement often comes at a tremendous cost. The relentless focus on outperforming others causes neglect of more fundamental questions about value and purpose.

人们过度沉迷于竞争胜利，反而忽略了真正重要的事物。固然，竞争能通过横向比较推动特定领域的进步，但这种提升往往伴随着巨大代价——对超越他人的执着追求，让人忽视了关于价值与目标的本质思考。

## 创新策略与市场差异化

Truly important and valuable opportunities often lie beyond conventional paths. Instead of rushing through the crowded narrow door everyone uses, consider turning the corner to explore the vast, untaken gate. Thank you. We now have time for a few questions.

真正重要且有价值的机会往往存在于常规路径之外。与其挤进人人争抢的狭窄之门，不如转向探索那道无人问津的广阔大门。谢谢。现在我们可以进行简短问答。

When assessing whether an idea surpasses your own, focus on identifying the actual market rather than market narratives. People often construct fictional stories that exaggerate or minimize market size. The key is to determine the real, objective market while recognizing that incentives frequently drive significant distortions in these assessments.

在评估某个想法是否优于自身创意时，应聚焦于识别真实市场而非市场叙事。人们常会编造夸大或缩小市场规模的故事。关键在于识别客观真实的市场，同时认识到利益驱动往往会导致这些判断严重失真。

### 垄断特征

Google exemplifies four key monopoly attributes: network effects through its advertising network, proprietary technology like the PageRank algorithm that initially provided an order-of-magnitude advantage over competitors, economies of scale from storing vast website data, and strong brand recognition. While its proprietary technology may have weakened slightly, Google historically possessed all four characteristics and likely maintains three today.

谷歌具备垄断企业的四大特征：通过广告网络实现的网络效应、初期凭借 PageRank 算法获得数量级优势的专有技术、存储海量网站数据形成的规模经济，以及强大的品牌认知。虽然其专有技术优势可能略有减弱，但谷歌历史上完整具备这四项特征，目前很可能仍保持其中三项。

### 创业方法论批评

Regarding lean startup methodology that uses iterative feedback to mitigate risk—versus creating complex, enduring systems—I maintain skepticism. Truly transformative companies typically achieve quantum improvements that fundamentally differentiate them. Palantir exemplifies this by focusing on the niche intelligence community market with proprietary human-computer synthesis technology, contrasting with the prevalent substitution paradigm.

关于通过迭代反馈规避风险的精益创业模式与创建复杂持久系统之间的对比，我持怀疑态度。真正变革性的企业通常实现质的飞跃从而根本性脱颖而出。Palantir 通过专有的人机协同技术聚焦小众情报机构市场，正是对此的诠释，这与主流的替代范式形成鲜明对比。

## 商业战略见解

Many companies conduct extensive customer surveys. However, the leaders of these enterprises sometimes exhibit mild Asperger's-like traits, making them less swayed by external opinions or directives. Consequently, I believe we overemphasize iterative approaches while undervaluing the ability to intuitively understand public needs through independent reasoning.

许多公司会进行大规模的客户调研。但企业领导者有时会表现出轻度阿斯伯格综合征特征，因此他们实际上不太容易受他人观点或指令影响。我认为我们过度聚焦于迭代模式，却未能充分培养通过独立推理来直观理解公众需求的能力。

Risk assessment remains particularly challenging because true risk mitigation often requires more time than available. If you spend excessive time determining market demands, you may miss critical opportunities. Additionally, there exists the inherent risk of pursuing insignificant endeavors. For instance, while law school may appear low-risk professionally, it carries the high risk of leading an unfulfilling career. Thus, risk must be evaluated through multidimensional analysis as an inherently complex concept.

风险评估尤其复杂，因为真正的风险缓解通常需要超出可用时间。若耗费过多时间判断市场需求，可能错失关键机遇。此外还存在追求无意义事业的内在风险。例如法学院从职业角度看似乎低风险，但存在导致职业生涯缺乏成就感的高风险。因此必须通过多维分析来评估风险这一本质复杂的概念。

### 竞争与垄断动态

Regarding competitive frameworks, we must recognize that market categories naturally group participants together. True monopolistic enterprises often function as decisive first-movers. While Google wasn't the first search engine, its PageRank algorithm represented such dramatic improvement on a key dimension that it redefined the category. Similarly, Facebook wasn't the inaugural social platform but achieved dominance through innovative execution.

关于竞争框架，我们必须认识到市场类别会自然将参与者分组。真正的垄断企业通常扮演决定性先行者角色。谷歌虽非首个搜索引擎，但其 PageRank 算法在关键维度上的突破性改进重新定义了该类别。同理，Facebook 虽非首个社交平台，但通过创新执行实现了市场主导地位。

### 社交网络的起源与发展

The first social networking site was actually launched by my friend Reed Hoffman in 1997, called SocialNet. This company incorporated the term "social networking" in its name seven years before Facebook's inception. Their vision involved creating a virtual cyberspace where users could assume alternative identities—such as me being a dog and you being a cat—with unique interaction rules governing this virtual alternate reality. Facebook revolutionized this concept by becoming the first platform to prioritize real identities. While people often overlook this distinction by grouping all social networks together, I consider Facebook the pioneer in this critical dimension and hope it remains the final evolution of social networking platforms.

第一个社交网站实际上由我的朋友里德·霍夫曼于 1997 年创立，名为 SocialNet。这家公司比 Facebook 早七年就将"社交网络"这一术语纳入企业名称。他们的愿景是创建一个虚拟网络空间，用户可以扮演不同身份——比如我扮演狗，你扮演猫——并在这个虚拟替代现实中遵循独特的互动规则。Facebook 通过成为首个强调真实身份的平台彻底改变了这一概念。虽然人们常常忽略这一区别而将所有社交网络混为一谈，但我认为 Facebook 在这一关键维度上是开创者，并希望它成为社交网络平台的最终形态。

### 关于职业选择的思考

Regarding career guidance for someone transitioning from Golden College to Stanford for scientific research, I must clarify I'm not skilled in psychotherapy. However, interesting studies on business school students reveal patterns worth noting. Harvard Business School research highlights an "anti-Asperger" personality type—highly extroverted individuals with low conviction density in a pressurized environment. After two years, the largest cohort systematically pursues misguided paths, chasing trends like working for Mike Milken before his imprisonment, or timing the dot-com bubble and housing peak. This reflects our deep-seated tendency to perceive competition as validation. While there's no simple psychological formula to avoid this, the fundamental realization—often accounting for just 10% of the solution—is to acknowledge how universally this problem affects us, not just business school students or Wall Street professionals.

关于从金学院转至斯坦福从事科研工作的职业指导，我必须说明我不擅长心理辅导。但针对商学院学生的有趣研究揭示了值得关注的模式。哈佛商学院研究指出一种"反阿斯伯格"人格类型——高度外向但缺乏坚定信念的个体在高压环境中，经过两年后最大群体系统性地走上错误道路，例如在迈克·米尔肯入狱前追随其工作，或精准追逐互联网泡沫和房地产热潮。这反映了我们将竞争视为认可的深层倾向。虽然避免这种情况没有简单的心理公式，但最基本的认知——通常仅占解决方案的 10%——是要承认这个问题普遍影响着所有人，而不仅仅是商学院学生或华尔街专业人士。

## 广告影响的心理学

Advertisements clearly work on people to some extent. Who are these individuals persuaded by television commercials? While some may consider them naive, these marketing techniques actually affect all of us to a disturbing degree. This is something we should collectively strive to overcome.

广告显然在一定程度上对人们产生影响。那些被电视广告说服的都是什么样的人？虽然有些人可能认为他们天真，但这些营销技巧实际上以令人不安的程度影响着我们所有人。这是我们应当共同努力克服的问题。
