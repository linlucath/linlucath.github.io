But if you get this right, this is probably the class that we refer to this term startup all the time. And probably in the back of your head, you kind of know that by startup we mean there has to be some legal entity. And that's kind of separate legal entity. We'll talk a little bit more about how we actually set that up and what that means to you. And you also probably know that a startup will have assets: IP, inventions, other things. And that the company needs to protect those. So we'll talk a little bit more about that. About how to raise money, hiring employees, and entering into contracts. So there's a few other things that you need to talk about whilst you're setting up your company, which kind of ferrets out a few issues amongst founders. Things like who's going to be in charge and how much equity is everybody going to own. So those are really good things to talk about too.

但如果你们正确理解这一点，这可能是我们经常提到"初创企业"这个术语的课程。可能在你们脑海深处，你们大概知道我们所说的初创企业必须要有某种法律实体。那是一种独立的法律实体。我们将进一步讨论如何实际建立这种实体以及这对你们意味着什么。你们可能也知道初创企业将拥有资产：知识产权、发明创造和其他东西。公司需要保护这些资产。所以我们也会进一步讨论这个问题。关于如何融资、招聘员工以及签订合同。在建立公司时，还有一些其他事项需要讨论，这些事项有助于发现创始人之间的一些问题。比如谁将负责管理，每个人将拥有多少股权。所以这些也是很好的讨论话题。

So then the question is, where do you form one? Theoretically you have 50 choices, but the easiest place is Delaware. I'm sure you're all familiar with that as well. Delaware is in the business of forming corporations. The law there is very clear and very settled; it's the standard. The other thing is that investors are very comfortable with Delaware. They already invest in companies that are Delaware corporations. Most of their investments are probably Delaware corporations. So if you are also a Delaware corporation, then everything just becomes much more simple. There's less diligence for the investor to do. You don't have to have a conversation about whether or not to reincorporate your Washington company into Delaware. So there's a reason that so many companies do it. It's standard. It's familiar.

那么问题来了，你应该在哪里成立公司？理论上你有50个选择，但最简单的地方是特拉华州。我相信你们对此都很熟悉。特拉华州专门从事公司注册业务。那里的法律非常明确且稳定，这是标准做法。另外，投资者对特拉华州非常放心。他们已经在投资特拉华州注册的公司。他们的大部分投资可能都是特拉华州公司。所以如果你也是一家特拉华州公司，那么一切都会变得简单得多。投资者需要做的尽职调查更少。你不需要讨论是否将你在华盛顿的公司重新注册到特拉华州。所以这么多公司选择这样做是有原因的。这是标准做法。这是大家熟悉的。

So I'll tell you a story. Connecticut LLC. And I'll just say this: four different law firms were needed to figure that one out. Two in Delaware, one in Connecticut, one here in the Silicon Valley, and the bill right now is at $500,000 for a conversion mistake. So what's the takeaway here? Pretty simple. Keep it really simple and familiar for yourself. The reason we incorporate all companies the same way at Y Combinator is because it's easy. So don't get fancy. Just save yourself some time and money.

我来给大家讲个故事。康涅狄格州有限责任公司。我只想说：为了解决这个问题，我们找了四家不同的律师事务所。两家在特拉华州，一家在康涅狄格州，一家在硅谷这里，目前账单已经达到50万美元，就因为一个转换错误。那么这里的经验教训是什么？很简单。保持简单明了，选择自己熟悉的方式。我们在Y Combinator对所有公司都采用相同的注册方式，就是因为这样很简单。所以不要追求花哨。给自己节省时间和金钱。

Okay. So once you've decided that you're going to be a Delaware corporation, how do you actually set that up? It requires a few different steps, but the first one is actually really easy. You literally just fax two pieces of paper into Delaware saying, we're going to set up a corporation. All that does though is create a shell of a company. It doesn't actually do anything within the company.

好的。一旦你决定要成立特拉华州公司，具体该如何操作呢？这需要几个不同的步骤，但第一步其实非常简单。你只需要传真两张纸到特拉华州，说明我们要成立一家公司。但这只是创建了一个公司外壳。实际上并没有在公司内部做任何事情。

So after that, you then need to complete a set of documents that among other things approve the bylaws of the company. It creates a board of directors, it creates offices of the company. Delaware requires that somebody has the title of CEO or president, and of secretary. So also at this point, you need to complete documents that assign any inventions or any code or anything that you as an individual create, so that the company actually owns that.

因此在那之后，你需要完成一套文件，其中包括批准公司章程。这会创建董事会，设立公司职位。特拉华州要求必须有人担任CEO或总裁，以及秘书的职务。同样在这个阶段，你需要完成文件，将任何发明、代码或个人创造的内容转让给公司，这样公司才能真正拥有这些资产。

And remember at this point, it's a really good thing to think about. You as founders have to think about things in two different ways.

请记住，在这个阶段，这是一个值得认真思考的问题。作为创始人，你必须从两个不同的角度来思考问题。

You always have to be

Thinking, am I doing this as an individual? As me? Or am I doing this on behalf of the company, which is a separate entity? So you have to maintain that split in your mind going through all of this. And we'll talk more about where that comes in a little bit later. So there are services that can help you get incorporated. Of course you can use a law firm, but there are also other online services that help. And the one we often use with a lot of the YC companies is called Clearkie, Clearkie.com. And they are set up so that all the standard, basic documents are used and they get you set up in a very vanilla way, so that you can just move on and keep focusing on what you need to do.

思考一下，我是作为个人在做这件事吗？作为我自己？还是我代表公司这个独立实体在做这件事？因此，在处理所有这些事情时，你必须在脑海中保持这种区分。我们稍后会进一步讨论这一点。有一些服务可以帮助你完成公司注册。当然你可以使用律师事务所，但也有其他在线服务可以提供帮助。我们经常与许多YC公司使用的是Clearkie，Clearkie.com。他们的设置确保使用所有标准、基础的文件，并以非常标准化的方式帮你完成设置，这样你就可以继续前进，专注于你需要做的事情。

So a note on paperwork. You're creating documents. These are really important documents that are going to be affecting what the company does, and what the company is. So it's really, really important that you actually keep these signed documents in a safe place. And it sounds so basic, but we get so many founders coming to us saying, "Oh, I don't know. These, these, some documents." And they have no idea what they are or where they are. So really, really make sure that you keep them in a safe place.

关于文书工作的注意事项。你正在创建文件。这些是非常重要的文件，将影响公司的运营和性质。因此，将这些签署好的文件保存在安全的地方真的非常重要。这听起来很基础，但我们遇到太多创始人来找我们说："哦，我不知道。这些，这些，一些文件。"他们完全不知道这些文件是什么或在哪里。所以，真的，真的确保你把它们保存在安全的地方。

And let's be honest, this is not the glamorous part of running a startup, you know, filing documents. But actually at the times where this is crucial are going to be at really high stress times in the startup's life. It's likely to be if the company's raising a big Series A round, or if the company's being acquired. The company will have to go through due diligence, and there will be lawyers asking for all this stuff.

老实说，这不是经营初创公司中光鲜亮丽的部分，你知道的，整理文件。但实际上，这些文件至关重要的时刻往往出现在初创公司生命周期中压力极大的时期。可能是在公司进行大规模A轮融资时，或者公司被收购时。公司将不得不经历尽职调查，会有律师要求提供所有这些材料。

And if you don't have it and you don't know where it is, it's just making a really stressful situation even more stressful. So really, the key thing here is, like we say, keep it simple, but keep those documents in a safe place and keep it organized. It will make your life so much easier.

如果你没有这些文件，也不知道它们在哪里，这只会让原本就压力很大的情况变得更加糟糕。所以，这里的关键是，正如我们所说，保持简单，但要把这些文件放在安全的地方并保持井井有条。这会让你的生活轻松很多。

The next thing you want to think about is how much stock should be allocated among the founders. From our perspective, the simple answer is probably yes. Our mantra at Y Combinator is that stock allocation doesn't have to be exactly equal, but if it's very disproportionate, that's a huge red flag for us. We wonder what conversation is not happening among the founder team when the ownership isn't equal. For example, is one founder secretly thinking that this whole startup thing is temporary? Is one founder over inflating the work that he or she has already done on the company or over inflating his or her education or prior experience? Do the founders really trust each other and have they been honest with each other about their expectations for this startup and for the future? So when ownership is disproportionate, what we worry about is that the founders are not in sync with one another.

接下来需要考虑的是，应该在创始人之间如何分配股权。从我们的角度来看，简单的答案可能是应该平均分配。Y Combinator 的信条是，股权分配不必完全相等，但如果非常不均衡，这对我们来说是一个巨大的警示信号。我们想知道当所有权不平等时，创始团队中哪些对话没有发生。例如，是否有一位创始人暗自认为整个创业只是暂时的？是否有一位创始人夸大他或她为公司所做的工作，或者夸大他或她的教育背景或先前经验？创始人之间是否真正信任彼此，并且对于这次创业和未来的期望是否彼此坦诚？因此，当所有权不均衡时，我们担心的是创始人之间没有达成一致。

Thirdly, it's really important to look forward in the startup and not backwards. Are all the founders in it 100%? Are they in it for the long haul? If the expectation at your startup is that each founder is in it 100% and you're all in it for the long haul, then everything that happened before the formation of the company shouldn't matter. It doesn't matter who thought of the idea. It doesn't matter who did the coding, or who built the prototype, or which one has an MBA. It will feel better to the whole team if the allocation is equal, because the whole team is necessary for execution. So, here's the take away on this point. In the top YC companies, which we call those with the highest evaluations, there are zero instances where ownership is unequal.

第三，在创业中向前看而不是向后看非常重要。所有创始人都百分之百投入吗？他们都准备长期坚持吗？如果你的创业公司期望每个创始人都百分之百投入，并且你们都准备长期坚持，那么公司成立之前发生的一切都不应该重要。谁想到了这个创意并不重要。谁编写了代码，或者谁构建了原型，或者谁拥有MBA学位都不重要。如果分配平等，整个团队会感觉更好，因为整个团队对于执行都是必要的。所以，关于这一点的重要启示是：在我们称之为估值最高的顶级YC公司中，没有股权不平等的实例。

There are zero instances where the founders have had significantly disproportionate equity split. Alright, so you've had the conversation about how to split the equity. But then what? Again, we talked to many founders who were actually surprised that they have to do something in order to own this stock. They think that talking about this is actually enough. And this again is another situation where you have to think about you as an individual, versus you as a representative of the company. If you equate this to a large company, if you worked at Google and you were told as part of your compensation package that you would be receiving some shares, you would expect to sign something to get those shares. And if you didn't, you'd be thinking, oh what's going on here? Well, it's the same thing with a small company as well. So in this case the documents that you're signing is a stock purchase agreement. So you as an individual, buy the shares from the company. In any situation, if you're buying something, there's a two-way transaction where you pay for something and you get something in return. In this case you're getting shares in return for either a cash payment, or for contributing IP, or inventions, or code to the company, so that the company actually owns everything that you've done in the past. So, we also refer to that stock being restricted because it vests over time. And we're going to cover that next in more detail. But, as a result of the stock being restricted investing, there's one very very crucial piece of paper.

在创始人股权分配显著不均衡的情况下，这种情况从未发生过。好的，既然你们已经讨论了如何分配股权。但接下来呢？我们与许多创始人交谈过，他们实际上很惊讶地发现，为了拥有这些股份，他们必须采取一些行动。他们认为讨论这个问题就足够了。这又是另一种情况，你必须考虑作为个人的自己，与作为公司代表的自己之间的区别。如果你将其与一家大公司相类比，如果你在谷歌工作，并被告知作为薪酬方案的一部分，你将获得一些股份，你会期望签署一些文件来获得这些股份。如果你没有签署，你会想，这是怎么回事？对于小公司来说也是一样的。在这种情况下，你签署的文件是一份股票购买协议。因此，作为个人，你从公司购买股份。在任何情况下，如果你购买某物，都会有一个双向交易，你支付某物并得到某物作为回报。在这种情况下，你获得股份作为现金支付，或为公司贡献知识产权、发明或代码的回报，这样公司实际上就拥有了你过去所做的一切。因此，我们也将这种股票称为受限股票，因为它会随着时间的推移而归属。我们接下来将更详细地讨论这一点。但是，由于股票是受限投资，有一份非常非常关键的文件。

We talk about this until we're blue in the face to everybody, because there's actually no way to go back and fix this. This is actually one of the things that, because there's no way to fix this, has blown up deals in the past. We've seen companies where, because they haven't filed what's called an 83(b) election, deals have blown up. I'm not going to go into detail about what that 83(b) election is actually about, but just leave it as it affects your individual taxes, and it affects the company's taxes. It can have a big impact. So here we have the main things: sign the paperwork, sign the stock purchase agreement, sign the 83(b) election, and make sure that you actually have proof that you sent that in. Because if you don't have the proof, it just goes into a black hole at the IRS, and investors and acquirers will walk away from a deal if you can't prove that.

我们反复向每个人强调这一点，因为实际上没有办法回头修复这个问题。这实际上是过去导致交易失败的事情之一，因为无法修复这个问题。我们见过一些公司因为没有提交所谓的83(b)选择而导致了交易失败。我不会详细说明83(b)选择的具体内容，但需要知道它会影响你的个人税务，也会影响公司的税务。这可能产生重大影响。所以这里的主要事项是：签署文件，签署股票购买协议，签署83(b)选择，并确保你实际拥有已提交的证明。因为如果你没有证明，它就会在国税局石沉大海，而如果你无法证明这一点，投资者和收购方就会放弃交易。

Okay. So the next thing we're going to talk about is vesting. I imagine that many of you are familiar with what vesting is. But just in case, really simply vesting means that you get full ownership of your stock over a specific period of time. So we're talking about the stock that Chrissie just said, you bought your stock of your company, and you own it and you get to vote it. But if you leave before this vesting period is over, then the company can get some of those unvested shares back. Just so you guys know the other ways to refer to vesting, you'll hear restricted stock. That means that stock that's subject to vesting. The IRS speak for this is shares that are

好的。接下来我们要讨论的是归属期。我想你们很多人都熟悉什么是归属期。但以防万一，简单来说，归属期意味着你在特定时间段内逐步获得股票的完全所有权。我们说的是Chrissie刚才提到的股票，你购买了公司的股票，你拥有它并且可以行使投票权。但如果你在归属期结束前离开，公司可以收回那些尚未归属的股份。为了让你们了解归属期的其他表述方式，你们会听到限制性股票这个术语。这指的是受归属期约束的股票。国税局对此的表述是

shares that are

So, it's a little terminology there. What should a typical vesting period be? In Silicon Valley, the so-called standard vesting period is four years with a one year cliff. This means that after one year, the founder vests in or fully owns, 25% of the shares. Then the remaining shares vest monthly over the next three years.

这里涉及一些专业术语。典型的归属期应该是多长？在硅谷，所谓的标准归属期是四年，其中包含一年的悬崖期。这意味着一年后，创始人将获得或完全拥有25%的股份。然后剩余股份将在接下来的三年内按月归属。

Here's an example. Founder buys stock on Christmas Day, let's say, and then quits the company on the following Thanksgiving, so before the year is passed. In that case, the founder leaves with zero shares, right, cliff period hasn't been met.

举个例子。假设创始人在圣诞节购买了股票，然后在接下来的感恩节辞职，也就是在一年期满之前。在这种情况下，创始人离开时不会获得任何股份，因为悬崖期尚未满足。

If the founder quits the day after the next Christmas, so a year and a day later, he or she's vested in exactly 25% of the shares, right? In that case, the one year cliff has been met.

如果创始人在下一个圣诞节的第二天辞职，也就是一年零一天后，他或她将正好获得25%的股份，对吗？在这种情况下，一年的悬崖期已经满足。

What happens to the shares when a founder stops working at the company? Company can repurchase those shares. In the example I just gave, where the founder quit a year and a day after purchasing the shares, 75% of those shares are still unvested. And the company will repurchase that full 75% of those shares from the founder.

当创始人停止在公司工作时，股份会怎样处理？公司可以回购这些股份。在我刚才给出的例子中，创始人在购买股份一年零一天后辞职，其中75%的股份仍未归属。公司将从创始人那里回购全部75%的股份。

How? Just writes the founder a check. That's how the founder bought it, right? So, it's the same price per share that the founder paid, and it's really just giving the founder his or her money back.

如何操作？只需给创始人开一张支票。这就是创始人当初购买股份的方式，对吗？所以，每股价格与创始人支付的价格相同，实际上只是将创始人的钱退还给他或她。

So then the question is, why would you have vesting? Why would founders do this to themselves, right?

那么问题来了，为什么要有归属期？创始人为什么要这样对待自己呢？

Because it's just the founders, they're doing this on their own shares. The number one reason why vesting is important has to do with founders leaving the company. Without vesting, if a founder leaves, a huge chunk of the equity ownership leaves with him or her. That is not fair to the founders left behind. We'll talk about this more when we get to the founder employment slide. The other reason to have vesting is the concept of skin in the game. Founders need to be incentivized to keep working on their startup. If a founder can walk away with full ownership at any time, why would they stay and grind away? Startups are hard. Do single founders need vesting? They do, because the skin in the game concept applies to solo founders as well. Investors want to see all founders, even solo founders, incentivized to stay at the company for a long time. The other reason that single founders should put vesting on their shares is to set an example for employees. It would be inappropriate for a founder to tell an employee about four-year vesting while not having any on their own shares. It's really a culture point. A founder who has vesting on their shares sets the tone for the company, saying we're all in it for the long haul and we all have vesting on our shares.

因为这仅仅是创始人在他们自己的股份上这样做。股权兑现之所以重要的首要原因与创始人离开公司有关。如果没有股权兑现，当创始人离开时，很大一部分股权所有权会随他或她一起离开。这对留下的创始人不公平。我们将在讨论创始人雇佣相关幻灯片时进一步探讨这一点。设立股权兑现的另一个原因是"利益绑定"的概念。需要激励创始人继续为他们的初创公司工作。如果创始人可以随时带着全部所有权离开，他们为什么还要留下来艰苦奋斗呢？初创公司本就艰难。那么，单独创始人需要股权兑现吗？需要，因为利益绑定的概念同样适用于单独创始人。投资者确实希望看到所有创始人，包括单独创始人，都有动力长期留在公司。单独创始人应该对其股份设置股权兑现的另一个原因是为员工树立榜样。可以想象，如果创始人告诉员工必须对其股份设置四年兑现期，而自己却认为不需要对自己的股份这样做，这是不合适的。这实际上是一个文化问题。对自己的股份设有股权兑现的创始人为公司定下了基调，表明我们都致力于长期发展，我们都对自己的股份设有股权兑现。

So, what are the takeaways from here? I would say vesting alliance incentives among the founders, if they all have to stick it out and grow the company before any of them get any of that company. And then number two, investors don't want to put money in a company where the founders can quit whenever they feel like it and still have a big equity ownership stake in that company.

那么，这里的关键要点是什么？我认为是创始人之间的股权兑现联盟激励机制，如果他们都需要坚持到底并发展公司，然后才能获得公司股权。第二点是，投资者不愿意投资那些创始人可以随时退出却仍持有大量公司股权的企业。

Okay, so moving on. We've now got a beautifully formed corporation in Delaware. Everybody's got their stock. It's all the plain vanilla standard paperwork. So, then what? Probably the next stage of a company's life is needing to raise some money. So we're going to talk a bit more about that.

好的，我们继续。现在我们已经在特拉华州成立了一个结构完善的公司。每个人都获得了自己的股份。这些都是标准的常规文件。那么接下来呢？公司生命周期的下一个阶段很可能就是需要筹集资金。所以我们将进一步讨论这个问题。

We know that you've already heard a lot from investors and from founders already in this set of classes. They've been talking much more around the tactics and how to raise money, but what about the paperwork? What about when somebody actually agrees to invest, then what?

我们知道你们在这系列课程中已经听到了很多来自投资者和创始人的分享。他们更多地讨论了融资策略和如何筹集资金，但是相关文件呢？当有人真正同意投资时会发生什么？

First of all in terms of logistics, in very simple terms there are two ways to raise money. Either the price is set for the money that comes in or the price isn't set. By price, we mean the valuation of the company - it's the same thing.

首先在操作流程方面，简单来说有两种筹集资金的方式。要么为投入的资金设定价格，要么不设定价格。这里所说的价格，我们指的是公司的估值 - 这是同一个概念。

Rounds can actually be called anything people want. But generally if you hear the term seed round, it would mean that the price has not been set, and anything that's a Series A or a Series B would be something where the price has been set. So not setting the price is the most straightforward, fast route to getting money.

融资轮次实际上可以随意命名。但通常来说，如果你听到种子轮这个术语，意味着价格尚未确定；而A轮或B轮融资则意味着价格已经确定。因此，不设定价格是获得资金最直接、最快速的途径。

And usually the way that this

This is done through convertible notes or safes. This is a two-way transaction. There's a piece of paper that says, for example, that an investor is paying $100,000 now and in return has the right to receive stock at a future date when the price is set by investors in a priced round. It's important to note that at the time the paperwork is set, that investor is not a shareholder and therefore doesn't have any voting rights on the company. They will have some other rights which Carolynn is going to talk about separately. Of course, investors want something in return for putting in money at the earliest, ie riskiest, stage of the company's life. This is where the concept of valuation cap comes in, which I'm sure many of you have heard mentioned before. Usually the documents for an unpriced round set a cap for the conversion into shares. That's not the current valuation of the company - it's actually an upper bound on the valuation used in future to calculate how many shares that investor is going to get. For example, an investor that invests $100,000 on a safe with a $5 million cap, then a year later the company raises a priced round with valuation of, let's say $20 million. The early investor would have a much lower price per share, about a quarter, and therefore that $100,000 would buy them approximately four times more shares than an investor that was coming in and putting in $100,000 in that Series A priced round. That's where they get their reward for being in early. This is another situation where you need to make sure you have the signed documents.

这是通过可转换债券或SAFE协议完成的。这是一个双向交易。例如，文件规定投资者现在支付10万美元，作为回报，有权在未来定价轮中由投资者设定价格时获得股份。需要注意的是，在文件签署时，该投资者并非股东，因此对公司没有任何投票权。他们将拥有其他一些权利，Carolynn将另行讨论。当然，投资者希望在最早（即风险最高）的公司阶段投入资金后获得回报。这就是估值上限概念的由来，我相信你们很多人都听说过。通常，非定价轮的文档会设定转换为股份的上限。这不是公司的当前估值，实际上是未来用于计算该投资者将获得多少股份的估值上限。例如，一位投资者以500万美元的上限通过SAFE协议投资10万美元，一年后公司以2000万美元的估值进行定价轮融资。那么早期投资者的每股价格将低得多，约为四分之一，因此他们的10万美元将比在A轮定价轮中投入10万美元的投资者多获得约四倍的股份。这就是他们早期进入所获得的回报。这是另一个需要确保您已签署文件的情况。

This is done through convertible documents, and you need to know where they are because different investors may have different rights. You need to know what those things are. Services like Clerky can help with that. They have very standard documents that most of our YC companies use to raise money.

这是通过可转换文件完成的，你需要知道它们的位置，因为不同的投资者可能拥有不同的权利。你需要了解这些内容。像Clerky这样的服务可以帮助解决这个问题。它们拥有非常标准化的文件，我们YC的大多数公司都用这些文件来融资。

A couple of other things to think about when you are raising money. Hopefully you've got a really hot company that's doing great and it's really easy to raise money. But you should be aware that all these people throwing money at you does have some downsides. The first thing is to understand your future dilution.

融资时还需要考虑其他几个问题。希望你的公司非常热门，发展得很好，融资很容易。但你应该意识到，所有这些向你投资的人确实会带来一些不利因素。首先要了解你未来的股权稀释情况。

If you raise, let's say, $2 million on safes with a valuation cap of $6 million, then when those safes convert into equity, those early investors are going to own about 25% of the company. That's going to be in addition to the investors that are coming in at that priced round, who may want to own 20% of the company. So you've already at that point given away 45% of the company. So is this really what you want? The answer might be yes.

假设你以600万美元的估值上限通过SAFE协议融资200万美元，那么当这些SAFE转换为股权时，早期投资者将拥有公司约25%的股份。这还不包括在那轮定价融资中进入的投资者，他们可能想要拥有公司20%的股份。所以到那时你已经放弃了公司45%的股权。这真的是你想要的吗？答案可能是肯定的。

Remember that some money on a low valuation cap is infinitely better than no money at all. If those are the terms that you can get, then take that money. But it's just something to be aware of, and to follow through the whole process, so that you can see where this is going to lead you down the road.

记住，以较低估值上限获得一些资金总比完全没有资金要好得多。如果这是你能获得的条款，那就接受这些资金。但这只是需要注意的事项，并且要跟进整个过程，这样你就能看到这会把你引向何方。

The other thing to bear in mind is that the investors should be sophisticated. By that we mean that they have enough money to be able to invest and that they understand that investing in startups is a

另一件需要记住的事情是，投资者应该是成熟的。我们的意思是，他们有足够的资金进行投资，并且他们明白投资初创公司是一个

investors should be sophisticated. And by that we mean that they, they have enough money to be able to invest and that they, they understand that investing in startups is a

You know we see so many companies coming into us that say, oh yeah, my uncle put money in, or my neighbor put money in, and they've put in $5,000 or $10,000 each. And often, those are the investors that cause the most problems going forward, because they don't understand how this is a long term game. And so, they get to the point where they're sitting, thinking hm, I could actually do with that money back because I need a new kitchen. Or, you know this, this startup investing is not actually as exciting as all the TV shows and movies made it out to be. So, those cause problems to the company, you know, if they're asking for their money back. So, just be aware that you should really be getting money from people who are sophisticated and know what they're doing. And the term that you'll hear that refers to these people are that they are accredited investors. So really the main points here is keep it simple, raise your money using standard documents, make sure that you have people who understand what they're getting into, and understand what you're getting into in terms of future dilution.

你知道我们看到很多公司来找我们说，哦，我叔叔投了钱，或者我邻居投了钱，他们每人投了5000或10000美元。通常，这些投资者会在未来造成最多问题，因为他们不明白这是一个长期游戏。所以，他们会开始想，嗯，我其实需要拿回那笔钱，因为我需要装修新厨房。或者，你知道，初创企业投资实际上并不像所有电视节目和电影描绘的那么令人兴奋。所以，这些会给公司带来问题，如果他们要求拿回投资的话。因此，请注意，你真的应该从经验丰富、知道自己在做什么的人那里获得资金。你会听到用来指代这些人的术语是合格投资者。所以这里的主要要点是保持简单，使用标准文件筹集资金，确保你找到的人了解他们正在参与什么，也了解你在未来股权稀释方面将面临什么。

This is risky business for the company in the long run. At Y Combinator, Chris and I hear founders say all the time: "I didn't know what that was, I didn't know what I was signing. I didn't know I agreed to that." So really, the burden is on you to figure this stuff out. We're going to go over four common investor requests. The first one is board seat. Some investors will ask for a seat on your company's board of directors. The investor usually wants to be a director either because he or she really wants to keep tabs on their money, or because he or she really thinks they can help you run your business. You have to be really careful about adding an investor to your board. In most cases, you want to say no. Otherwise, make sure it's a person who's really going to add value. Having money is very valuable, but someone who really helps with strategy and direction is priceless, so choose wisely.

这对公司的长远发展来说是个风险业务。在Y Combinator，克里斯和我经常听到创始人们说："我不知道那是什么，我不知道我签了什么。我不知道我同意了那个。"所以实际上，责任在于你自己去弄清楚这些事情。我们将讨论四个常见的投资者要求。第一个是董事会席位。一些投资者会要求获得你公司董事会的席位。投资者通常希望成为董事，要么是因为他或她真的想密切关注他们的资金，要么是因为他或她真的认为他们可以帮助你经营业务。你必须非常谨慎地考虑将投资者加入董事会。在大多数情况下，你应该拒绝。否则，请确保这是一个真正能够增加价值的人。拥有资金非常有价值，但真正能在战略和方向上提供帮助的人是无价的，所以要明智选择。

The other thing is advisors. There are so many people who want to give advice to startups, and so few people who actually give good advice. Once an investor has given your company money, that person should be a de facto advisor but without any official title, and more importantly without the company having to give anything extra in return for the advice. Here's an example: At Y Combinator we've noticed that whenever a startup manages to garner a celebrity investor, the celebrity almost always asks to be an advisor. We have a company that provides on-demand bodyguard services, and an NBA basketball player invested, asked to be an advisor, and then asked to be given shares of common stock in exchange for the advisor services.

另一个是顾问问题。有很多人想给初创公司提供建议，但真正能给出好建议的人却很少。一旦投资者给你的公司投了钱，那个人就应该是一个事实上的顾问，但没有任何正式头衔，更重要的是公司不需要为这些建议额外付出任何回报。这里有一个例子：在Y Combinator，我们注意到每当一家初创公司成功吸引到名人投资者时，这位名人几乎总是要求成为顾问。我们有一家提供按需保镖服务的公司，一位NBA篮球运动员投资后，要求成为顾问，然后要求获得普通股作为顾问服务的交换。

And the services that this person had in mind, this investor had in mind, would be to introduce his company around to all the other professional basketball players who might want to use an on demand bodyguard. But, this celebrity just made a big investment. Shouldn't he want to help the company succeed anyway? Why does he need something extra? All investors who can help, should do so. Asking for additional shares is just an investor looking for a freebie.

这位投资者心中设想的服务是，将他的公司介绍给所有可能需要按需保镖服务的其他职业篮球运动员。但是，这位名人刚刚进行了大笔投资。难道他不应该希望帮助公司成功吗？为什么他需要额外的东西？所有能够提供帮助的投资者都应该这样做。要求额外股份只是投资者想要免费获得好处。

Okay, next we're going to talk about pro-rata rights. What are pro-rata rights? Some of you may have heard of this before. But, very simply it's the right to maintain your percentage ownership in a company by buying more shares in the company in the future. Pro-rata rights are a way to avoid dilution, and dilution in this context means owning less and less of the company each time the company sells more stock to other investors.

好的，接下来我们将讨论按比例权利。什么是按比例权利？你们中的一些人可能以前听说过这个。但是，简单来说，这是通过在将来购买公司更多股份来维持你在公司中百分比所有权的权利。按比例权利是避免稀释的一种方式，而在此背景下的稀释意味着每次公司向其他投资者出售更多股票时，你拥有的公司份额越来越少。

So, this is a really basic example but, say an early investor buys shares of preferred stock and ends up owning 3% of the company once the financing has closed. And the company raises another round of financing, and the company will go to this investor who negotiated and got pro-rata rights and say, hey, we're raising more money. So you're welcome to buy, you know, this many shares in the new round to keep your ownership at approximately 3%, that is pro-rata rights at their very most basic.

所以，这是一个非常基础的例子，假设一位早期投资者购买了优先股，并在融资结束后最终拥有公司3%的股份。当公司进行另一轮融资时，公司会去找这位谈判获得了按比例权利的投资者，并说："嘿，我们正在筹集更多资金。所以欢迎你购买这么多新轮次的股份，以保持你大约3%的所有权"，这就是最基本的按比例权利。

So pro-rata rights are a very common request from investors, and they are not necessarily a bad thing. But you absolutely as a founder need to know how pro-rata rights work. Especially because, Kirstie touched on this a little bit. The corollary to an investor having pro-rata rights to avoid dilution,

所以按比例权利是投资者非常常见的要求，它们不一定是坏事。但作为创始人，你绝对需要了解按比例权利是如何运作的。特别是因为Kirstie稍微提到了这一点。投资者拥有按比例权利以避免稀释的必然结果是，

The corollary to an investor having pro-rata rights to avoid dilution,

Founders typically suffer greater dilution. The final thing is information rights. Investors almost always want contractual information rights to get certain information about your company. Giving periodic information and status updates is not a bad thing. In fact at YC we encourage companies to give monthly updates to their investors, because it's a great opportunity to ask for help from your investors, like introductions or help with hiring, that kind of thing. But you have to be really careful about overreach. The investor who's saying they want like a month budget, or a weekly update, that's not okay. So the take-away here is that just because the type of financing and the valuation has been negotiated, doesn't mean that everything else is unimportant. You need to know everything about your financing.

创始人通常会遭受更大的股权稀释。最后一点是信息权。投资者几乎总是希望通过合同信息权来获取关于你公司的特定信息。提供定期的信息和状态更新并不是坏事。事实上在YC，我们鼓励公司每月向投资者提供更新，因为这是一个很好的机会来向投资者寻求帮助，比如介绍或招聘协助之类的事情。但你必须非常警惕过度要求。那些要求月度预算或每周更新的投资者是不可接受的。所以这里的要点是，仅仅因为融资类型和估值已经协商好了，并不意味着其他一切都不重要。你需要了解关于融资的所有细节。

The founders' expenses are typically not deductible on the tax return, so that can increase the profits that the company then has to pay tax on. This is a separation issue. The company will have its own bank accounts, and that's where the company's expenses should be paid from. Thinking about this from a large company perspective: if you were working at Google, you would not use a Google credit card to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste. The investors gave you this money because they trusted you with these huge amounts of money, and they want you to use that money to make the company a success. It's not your money for you to spend how you please. We've had horror stories of founders who take that approach, like one founder who took investor money and went to Vegas. Needless to say, he's no longer with the company. This is essentially stealing from the investors. The concept of business expenses can get blurry, especially in the early days when you're working from your apartment 24 hours a day. But the way to think about it is: if an investor asked for a line-by-line breakdown of how I spent their money, would I be embarrassed about telling them what any of those lines were? If you would be embarrassed, it's probably not a business expense.

创始人的开支通常无法在纳税申报表中抵扣，这会增加公司需要纳税的利润。这是一个分离问题。公司应该拥有自己的银行账户，公司的开支应该从这些账户中支付。从大公司的角度来思考：如果你在谷歌工作，你不会用谷歌的信用卡购买牙刷和牙膏。投资者给你这些钱是因为他们信任你，希望你用这些钱让公司成功。这不是你可以随意花费的个人资金。我们曾有过创始人滥用资金的可怕案例，比如有位创始人拿着投资人的钱去了拉斯维加斯。不用说，他不再与公司有关联了。这本质上是从投资者那里偷窃。业务开支的概念有时会变得模糊，特别是在早期阶段，当你在公寓里每天工作24小时时。但思考方式是：如果投资者要求我逐行说明如何花费他们的钱，我是否会因为其中任何一项开支而感到尴尬？如果你会感到尴尬，那可能就不是业务开支。

Just constant, constant. So you don't have to necessarily think about the bookkeeping and accounting at that point, but it's really crucial that you do keep the receipts, so that when you do engage a bookkeeper or a CPA to prepare your tax returns, they can unpick all of this and they can figure out what are business expenses and what aren't business expenses. But they're going to need your help as a founder, because they aren't going to know what all these things are. So, there is some involvement from you and the way to make the involvement the least amount possible, is to keep those documents in a safe place, so you can refer back to them. So, if nothing else that you remember do not go to Vegas on investors money and spend that money wisely.

这需要持续不断的坚持。因此，你不必在那个阶段过多考虑簿记和会计工作，但保留收据确实至关重要。这样当你聘请簿记员或注册会计师来准备纳税申报表时，他们能够梳理所有这些信息，分辨哪些是业务支出，哪些不是业务支出。但作为创始人，他们需要你的帮助，因为他们不会了解所有这些事项的具体情况。所以，你需要参与其中，而将参与程度降至最低的方法就是把那些文件妥善保管在安全的地方，以便日后查阅。总之，如果你只记住一件事，那就是不要拿着投资者的钱去拉斯维加斯挥霍，要明智地使用这些资金。

Okay, so in this section we're going to talk about just doing business and we're going to hit a couple of topics in this section. So the first one is founder employment. Why are we talking about founder employment? Because, as we said a couple times already, the company is a separate legal entity. It exists completely separate and apart from the founders, and so no matter how prestigious we in the valley think the title founder is, you're really just a company employee and founders have to be paid. Working for free is against the law, and founders should not let their company take on this liability. You wouldn't work for free anywhere else, so why is your startup an exception? And companies have to pay payroll taxes. We had a YC company that completely blew off their payroll taxes for three years, it was a huge, expensive disaster, and in extreme cases, people can actually go to jail for that, fortunately not in this case, but it's bad. So the moral of this story is setup a payroll service. This is something that is worth spending your money on. But don't go overboard on lavish salaries, minimum wage this is still a startup and you have to run lean.

好的，在本节中我们将讨论企业经营相关话题，我们会涉及几个主题。第一个是创始人雇佣问题。为什么我们要讨论创始人雇佣？因为正如我们已经多次提到的，公司是一个独立的法律实体。它完全独立于创始人而存在，所以无论我们在硅谷认为创始人这个头衔多么尊贵，你实际上只是公司员工，创始人必须获得报酬。无偿工作是违法的，创始人不应该让公司承担这种责任。你不会在其他任何地方免费工作，那为什么你的初创公司就是个例外？而且公司必须支付工资税。我们有一家YC公司完全忽视了他们的工资税三年之久，这是一场巨大而昂贵的灾难，在极端情况下，人们实际上可能因此入狱，幸运的是这个案例中没有，但这很糟糕。所以这个故事的教训是设立工资支付服务。这是值得你花钱的事情。但不要在奢侈的工资上过度花费，最低工资即可，这仍然是一家初创公司，你需要精打细算。

So now I'm going to mention founder breakups, and first, well what is a founder breakup? In this context I'm talking about one founder on the team being asked to leave the company. Which, because I've just said founders are employees, that means your cofounders are firing you. So why are we talking about breakups in the context of founder compensation, and it's because, at YC we have seen a ton of founder breakups and we know that the breakups get extra ugly when the founders haven't paid themselves. Why, how does it get ugly? Unpaid wages become leverage for the fired founder to get something he or she wants from the company, and typically that is vesting acceleration. So the fired founder says, hey, my lawyer says you broke the law by not paying me. But if you pay me, and you give me some shares that I'm not actually entitled to, I'll sign a release and make all this ugliness go away, and if you're the remaining cofounders, you're probably like, sounds like a good deal. And so now you have a disgruntled person who owns a piece of your company and even worse in a sense, the remaining founders are kind of working for that ex-founder, right? Because they're building all the value in the company and the ex-founder who got fired is just sitting there with their shares going, that's right, make it valuable. So, what's the takeaway here? Avoid problems by paying yourself, paying your payroll taxes, and thinking of your co-founder's wages like a marital prenup.

现在我要谈谈创始人分道扬镳的问题。首先，什么是创始人分道扬镳？在此背景下，我指的是团队中的一位创始人被要求离开公司。由于我刚刚说过创始人也属于员工，这意味着你的联合创始人正在解雇你。那么为什么我们要在创始人薪酬的背景下讨论分道扬镳呢？因为在YC我们见证了大量的创始人分道扬镳案例，我们知道当创始人没有给自己支付薪酬时，分手会变得特别难看。为什么会变得难看？未付工资成为被解雇创始人从公司获取他或她想要的东西的杠杆，通常这就是股权加速归属。所以被解雇的创始人会说，嘿，我的律师说你们不付我工资是违法的。但如果你们付我工资，再给我一些我本无权获得的股份，我就会签署免责协议让所有这些麻烦消失。如果你是留下的联合创始人，你可能会觉得这听起来是个不错的交易。于是现在你有了一个心怀不满的人拥有你公司的一部分股份，从某种意义上说更糟糕的是，留下的创始人某种程度上是在为那位前创始人工作，对吧？因为他们正在为公司创造所有价值，而被解雇的前创始人只是坐在那里持有股份，心想：没错，让它增值吧。那么，这里的启示是什么？通过给自己支付薪酬、缴纳工资税，以及将联合创始人的薪酬视为婚姻婚前协议来避免问题。

They'll be using their own equipment, and they'll not really have any say in the day to day running of the company or their strategy going forward. A contractor will sign a consulting agreement, and when the company pays them, the company doesn't withhold any taxes on their behalf, and that's on the responsibility of the individual. But at the end of the year, the company will provide what's called a form 1099 to the individual and also a copy to the IRS which they'll use to prepare their personal tax returns.

The opposite side of this is an employee, and an employee will also sign some form of IP assignment agreement. But when the company pays them, the company will withhold taxes from their salary, and then the company is responsible for paying those taxes over to the relevant State and Federal authorities. And at the end of the year the employee receives a W-2 form, which will then get used to prepare their personal tax returns.

So, as Carolina said, the founders need to be paid so do employees. It isn't enough to just say well I'm paying them in stock so that can be their compensation, and they need to be paid at least minimum wage. So, in San Francisco which actually has a slightly higher minimum wage than California as a whole, that works out to about $2000 a month, so it's not a huge amount, but it can add up.

There's also another couple of things that you need to make sure that you have if you have employees. So, the first thing is that you're required to have workers' compensation insurance, especially if you're in New York.

承包商将使用自己的设备，并且对公司的日常运营或未来战略没有真正的发言权。承包商将签署咨询协议，当公司支付报酬时，公司不会代扣任何税款，这属于个人的责任。但在年底，公司会向个人提供所谓的1099表格，同时向国税局提交副本，个人将使用这些表格来准备个人所得税申报。

与此相对的是雇员，雇员也会签署某种形式的知识产权转让协议。但当公司支付薪酬时，公司会从工资中预扣税款，然后公司负责将这些税款缴纳给相关的州和联邦机构。在年底，雇员会收到W-2表格，该表格将用于准备他们的个人所得税申报。

正如卡罗莱娜所说，创始人需要获得报酬，雇员也是如此。仅仅说用股票支付作为他们的报酬是不够的，他们至少需要获得最低工资。因此，在旧金山，那里的最低工资实际上略高于加州整体水平，每月约为2000美元，虽然这不是巨额款项，但会累积起来。

如果你有雇员，还需要确保满足另外几项要求。首先，你必须购买工伤保险，特别是在纽约的情况下。

The New York authorities that look after this will send really threatening letters, saying you owe $50,000 in fines because your one employee that's being paid minimum wage is not paid the $20 a month workers compensation fees. So it is really important that you do set that up. The other thing that is very important is that you do need to see proof that the employee is authorized to work in the U.S. Founders are not payroll experts, and nobody expects you to be one either. This is all just about the basics. What that does mean is that you absolutely must use a payroll service provider who will be able to look after this for you. Services like Zen Payroll are again set up, they're focused on startups and they help you get this set up in the easiest way possible, so that again you can go back and concentrate on what you do best. In the example that Caroline gave just a few minutes ago, if that company had actually set themselves up with a payroll service provider, all of that heartache would have gone away because it would all have just been looked after for them. They were trying to save money by not doing it, and look where it got them. So that's really the key thing: use a payroll service provider and make sure that you understand the basics of employment.

负责此事的纽约当局会寄出非常具有威胁性的信件，声称你欠缴5万美元罚款，因为你那位拿最低工资的员工没有支付每月20美元的工人赔偿金。因此，你确实需要设置好这一点非常重要。另一件非常重要的事情是，你确实需要查看证明员工有权在美国工作的文件。创始人不是薪资专家，也没有人期望你成为专家。这些都只是基础知识。这意味着你绝对必须使用能够为你处理这些事务的薪资服务提供商。像Zen Payroll这样的服务再次被设立，它们专注于初创公司，并帮助你以最简单的方式完成设置，这样你就可以重新专注于你最擅长的事情。在卡罗琳几分钟前给出的例子中，如果那家公司确实使用了薪资服务提供商，所有的烦恼都会消失，因为一切都会为他们处理妥当。他们试图通过不这样做来省钱，但看看结果如何。所以这确实是关键：使用薪资服务提供商，并确保你了解雇佣的基础知识。

We're running short on time. Somebody at YC once said you're not a real founder until you've had to fire somebody. Why is that? Because firing people is really hard. It's hard for a lot of reasons including because founders tend to hire their friends. They tend to hire former coworkers, or they just get really close to their employees because working in a startup is really intense. But in every company there is going to be an employee who doesn't work out. And firing this employee makes a founder a real professional because he or she has to do what is right for the company instead of what is easy.

So I have some best practices for how to fire someone. Number one, fire quickly. Don't let a bad employee linger. It's so easy to put off the difficult conversation but there is only downside to procrastination. If a toxic employee stays around too long, good employees may quit, and if the employee's actually screwing up the job, you may lose business or users. Number two, communicate effectively. Don't rationalize, don't make excuses, don't equivocate about why you're firing the employee. Make clear, direct statements, don't apologize. Example, we're letting you go. Not, I'm so sorry, sales didn't take off this quarter. Fire the employee face to face and ideally with a third party present. Number three, pay all wages and accrued vacation immediately. This is a legal requirement. We don't debate or negotiate this. Number four, cut off access to digital systems.

我们时间不多了。YC有人曾说过，直到你不得不解雇某人时，你才算是一个真正的创始人。为什么这么说？因为解雇人确实很难。这有很多原因，包括创始人倾向于雇佣自己的朋友。他们倾向于雇佣前同事，或者与员工变得非常亲近，因为在初创公司工作强度很大。但在每家公司都会有不合适的员工。解雇这名员工让创始人成为真正的专业人士，因为他或她必须做对公司正确的事，而不是做容易的事。

关于如何解雇某人，我有一些最佳实践。第一，快速解雇。不要让糟糕的员工拖延。推迟困难的谈话很容易，但拖延只会带来负面影响。如果有毒员工留得太久，优秀员工可能会离职，如果员工确实搞砸了工作，你可能会失去业务或用户。第二，有效沟通。不要合理化，不要找借口，不要对解雇原因含糊其辞。做出清晰、直接的陈述，不要道歉。例如，我们要让你离开。而不是说，我很抱歉，本季度销售没有起色等等。面对面解雇员工，最好有第三方在场。第三，立即支付所有工资和累积假期。这是法律要求。我们不对此进行辩论或谈判。第四，切断对数字系统的访问权限。

Once an employee is out the door, cut off physical and digital access. Control information on the cloud, change passwords, et cetera. We had a situation at YC where one founder had access to the company's GitHub account and held the password hostage when his cofounders tried to fire him. And number five, if the terminated has any investitures, the company should repurchase them right away. So, the take-away here is that, as surprising as this may sound, one of hallmarks of a really effective start-up founder is how well he or she handles employee terminations.

一旦员工离职，应立即切断其物理和数字访问权限。控制云端信息，更改密码等。我们在YC遇到过这样的情况：一位创始人拥有公司GitHub账户的访问权限，当他的联合创始人试图解雇他时，他扣留了密码作为要挟。第五点，如果被解雇者持有任何投资份额，公司应立即回购。因此，这里的要点是，尽管听起来可能令人惊讶，但真正有效的初创公司创始人的标志之一就是其处理员工解雇的能力。

Okay. So then, we had this section that we called legitimacy, which actually goes into a little bit more about making sure you actually know those rights. You and the employees need to be paid. And then, everybody needs to assign IP to the company. Because if the company does not own this IP, there is no value in the company. If an employee must be fired, then as Carolyn was saying, do it quickly and professionally. The couple of things that we didn't mention was knowing your key metrics. At any time, you should know the cash position, you should know your burn rate, you should know when that cash is going to run out. So that you can talk to your investors about that. A lot of running a company is following the rules and taking it seriously. It's not all the glamorous bits that we see in all the movies and TV shows, so you do have to take that seriously.

好的。接下来我们有一个称为合法性的部分，这部分实际上更深入地探讨确保你真正了解这些权利。你和员工都需要获得报酬。然后，每个人都需要将知识产权转让给公司。因为如果公司不拥有这些知识产权，公司就没有价值。如果必须解雇员工，那么正如卡罗琳所说，要快速且专业地处理。我们没提到的几点包括了解你的关键指标。在任何时候，你都应该了解现金状况，了解你的资金消耗率，了解这些现金何时会用完。这样你就可以与投资者讨论这些问题。经营公司很大程度上是遵守规则并认真对待。这并不全是我们在所有电影和电视节目中看到的那些光鲜亮丽的部分，所以你必须认真对待。

Make sure you actually know it's probably fine for the founders to just be able to see the bank statements and to be able to see those expenses coming out. But tax returns have to be prepared annually. And so, at some point in that first year of the company's life, some service is going to need to be engaged to do that, because it's just not worth the founder's time to do it. There are services available, like inDinero, which kind of try to make things as effortless as possible from the founder's point of view. So that kind of thing is quite useful, but you do need to get a CPA at some point because you need to file your annual tax returns for the company.

确保你真正明白，创始人只需能够查看银行对账单并了解这些支出情况可能就足够了。但纳税申报表必须每年准备。因此，在公司成立的第一年的某个时间点，需要聘请某些服务来完成这项工作，因为让创始人自己处理这件事不值得花费时间。有一些可用的服务，比如inDinero，它们试图从创始人的角度尽可能简化流程。这类服务相当有用，但你确实需要在某个时间点聘请注册会计师，因为你需要为公司提交年度纳税申报表。

How do you find one when you actually need to hire a lawyer? It depends on what business you are starting and how complicated it is. Do you have a lot of privacy policies? Is HIPAA involved? There are many factors to consider. It also depends on when you're raising your seed round. How much money are you raising? Who are the investors? What kind of terms are in the term sheet? Sometimes that dictates whether or not you need to get legal counsel. Again, a service like Clerky can help if you're just using very standard documents for fundraising. There are very basic, vanilla fundraising documents that you can use. They cost less than $100, I think, which can save you some legal fees.

当你真正需要聘请律师时该如何寻找？这取决于你创办的业务类型及其复杂程度。你是否有很多隐私政策？是否涉及HIPAA？需要考虑的因素很多。这也取决于你进行种子轮融资的时机。你筹集多少资金？投资者是谁？投资条款清单中包含哪些条款？有时这些因素决定了你是否需要寻求法律咨询。再次说明，如果你只是使用非常标准的融资文件，像Clerky这样的服务可以提供帮助。有一些非常基础的标准化融资文件可供使用。我认为它们的费用不到100美元，可以为你节省一些法律费用。

One more question, unfortunately.
Thank you very much.

还有一个问题，很不巧。
非常感谢。
