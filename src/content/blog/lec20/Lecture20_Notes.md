Yeah? All right. Good afternoon and welcome to the last class in how to start a startup. So this is a little bit different than every other class. Every other class has been things that you should be thinking about in general at the beginning of a startup. And today, we're going to talk about things that you don't have to think about for a while. In fact, you shouldn't. But since I'm not going to get to talk to most of you again before you get to sort of post-product market fit stage, I wanted to just give you the list of things that you need to think about as your startup scales, and the list of the things that usually founders failed to make the transition on. So these are the topics we're going to talk about, but again all of these things are things that are not writing code or talking to users. Which means, with a few exceptions that I'll try to note, you can ignore them until after you have product market fit. Most of these things, for most companies, become important between months 12 and 24. But it's really more about stage than anything else. These are things that usually hit around 25 people and definitely post product-market fit. So just write these down somewhere and look back at them when you get there. The first area we're going to talk about is management. At the beginning of a company there is no management, and this actually works really well. Before 20 or 25 employees most companies are structured with everyone reporting to the founder, it's totally flat. And that's really good, and that's what you want, and at that stage that is the optimal way for product, that's the optimal structure.

是吗？好的。下午好，欢迎来到"如何创办初创企业"的最后一堂课。这堂课与其他课程有些不同。其他课程主要涉及初创企业在初期阶段通常需要考虑的事项。而今天，我们将讨论那些暂时无需考虑的问题。事实上，你们也不应该过早考虑这些问题。但由于在你们进入产品市场匹配阶段后，我可能无法再与大多数人交流，我想提前列出随着初创企业规模扩大需要思考的事项清单，以及创始人通常难以顺利过渡的问题清单。这些就是我们今天要讨论的主题，但再次强调，所有这些事项都不涉及编写代码或与用户沟通。这意味着，除了一些我会特别指出的例外情况，在产品市场匹配之前你们可以忽略这些问题。对大多数公司而言，这些问题通常在12到24个月之间变得重要。但这实际上更多与公司发展阶段相关。这些问题通常在团队规模达到25人左右，且明确处于产品市场匹配后阶段时出现。所以请把这些内容记录下来，待时机成熟时再回顾。我们要讨论的第一个领域是管理。在公司初创阶段不存在管理，这种模式实际上运行得很好。在员工人数达到20-25人之前，大多数公司都采用全员向创始人汇报的扁平化结构。这种结构非常有效，也是你们所需要的，在这个阶段对产品开发而言是最优的组织形式。

For productivity, the thing that tricks people is that when lack of structure fails, it fails all at once. So what works totally fine at 20 employees is disastrous at 30. You want to be aware that this transition will happen, and you don't actually need to make the structure complicated. In fact, you shouldn't. All you need is for every employee to know who their manager is, and there should be exactly one. And every manager should know who their direct reports are. You want to ideally cluster people in teams that make sense of course. But the most important thing is that there's just clear reporting structure, and that everyone knows what it is. And if you want to make changes to it, people sort of understand how to make changes or to hire someone. Clarity and simplicity are the most important things here. But failing to do it is really bad. Because it works in the early days to have no structure at all, and because it sort of feels cool to have no structure, many companies are like, we're going to try this crazy new management theory and have no structure. What you want to do is innovate on your product and your business model. Management structure is not where I would recommend trying to innovate. So don't make the mistake of having nothing, but don't make the other mistake of having something super complicated. A lot of people fall into this trap where they think people feel cool if they're someone's manager.

关于工作效率，欺骗人们的是当缺乏结构失效时，它会突然完全失效。因此在20名员工时完全有效的方法在30名员工时就会变得灾难性。你需要意识到这种转变将会发生，而你实际上不需要让结构变得复杂。事实上，你不应该这样做。你只需要确保每个员工都知道他们的经理是谁，而且应该恰好只有一个。每个经理都应该知道他们的直接下属是谁。理想情况下，你当然应该将人们合理地分组到团队中。但最重要的是要有一个清晰的汇报结构，并且每个人都知道这个结构是什么。如果你想对其进行更改，人们应该大致了解如何进行更改或招聘人员。清晰和简单在这里是最重要的。但未能做到这一点确实很糟糕。因为在早期完全没有结构是可行的，而且完全没有结构感觉有点酷，许多公司会说，我们要尝试这种疯狂的新管理理论，不设任何结构。你应该做的是在你的产品和商业模式上进行创新。管理结构不是我建议尝试创新的领域。所以不要犯没有任何结构的错误，但也不要犯设置超级复杂结构的错误。很多人陷入这个陷阱，他们认为如果成为某人的经理会感觉很酷。

Is it from zero to 20 employees? And if they're just an employee they don't feel cool. So people come up with these convoluted circular matrices management structures, where you report to this person for this thing, and this person for that thing, and this person for that thing. But you know, actually this person reports to you for this thing. That's a mistake too. So don't try to innovate here. This is the first instance of an important shift in companies, or in the founders job. Before product market fit your only job that matters is to build a great product, right, you're number one job is to build a great product. As the company grows and at about this 25 or so employee size, your main job shifts from building a great product to building a great company, and it stays there for the rest of your time. And this is probably the biggest shift in being a founder that ever happens. There are four failure cases we see all the time as founders become managers. So I want to talk about the four most common ones. The first one is being afraid to hire senior people. In the early days of a startup, hiring senior people is usually a mistake. You just want people that get stuff done, and the willingness to work hard and aptitude matters more than experience. As the company starts to scale, and about this time when you have to put in place a basic management structure, it is actually valuable to have senior people on the team. You know, executives that have built companies before. And almost all founders after the first time they hire a really great executive and that executive takes over big pieces of the business and just makes them happen.

这是从零到二十名员工吗？如果员工只是普通员工，他们不会觉得酷。所以人们想出了这些复杂的循环矩阵管理结构，你为这件事向这个人汇报，为那件事向那个人汇报，为那件事向另一个人汇报。但你知道吗，实际上这个人还要为这件事向你汇报。这也是一个错误。所以不要在这方面尝试创新。这是公司或创始人工作中重要转变的第一个实例。在产品市场契合之前，你唯一重要的工作就是打造优秀的产品，没错，你的首要任务就是打造优秀的产品。随着公司发展，在员工规模达到25人左右时，你的主要工作从打造优秀产品转变为打造优秀公司，并且这种状态会持续下去。这可能是创始人职业生涯中最大的转变。在创始人转变为管理者的过程中，我们经常看到四种失败情况。所以我想谈谈四种最常见的情况。第一种是害怕雇佣资深人士。在初创公司早期，雇佣资深人士通常是个错误。你只需要能完成任务的人，工作意愿和能力比经验更重要。当公司开始扩大规模，大约在这个时候你需要建立基本的管理结构，团队中有资深人士实际上很有价值。那些曾经建立过公司的高管。几乎所有创始人在第一次雇佣真正优秀的高管后，当这位高管接管业务的重要部分并让它们顺利运转时。

The founder says, wow, I wish I had done that earlier. But everybody makes this mistake and waits too long to do this, so don't be afraid to hire senior executives. The second mistake is hero mode. I will use the example of someone that runs the customer service team. Someone runs the customer service team, they want to lead by example, this starts from a good place, it's the extreme of leading by example. It's saying, you know what, I want my team to work really hard. Rather than tell them to work hard I'm going to set an example and I'm going to work 18 hours a day. And I'm going to show people how to get a lot of tickets done. But then the company starts growing. Also they have the normal discomfort of assigning a lot of work to other people. So the company starts growing and the ticket volume keeps going up, and now they have to do like 19 hours a day, and then 20 hours a day, and it's just obviously not working. But they won't stop and hire people, because they're like, if I stop, even for one day, we're going to get behind on tickets. The only way to get out of hero mode in this case is to say, you know what? We're going to get behind on tickets for two or three weeks, because I'm going to go off. And I'm going to hire three more support team members and I've calculated based off our growth rate that this is going to last this long. And next time, I'm not going to make the same mistake. I'll get ahead of it and hire again. But you actually have to make a tradeoff.

创始人说，哇，我真希望我早点这么做。但每个人都会犯这个错误，等待太久才采取行动，所以不要害怕聘请高级管理人员。第二个错误是英雄模式。我将以客户服务团队负责人为例。有人负责客户服务团队，他们想以身作则，这始于良好的初衷，但这是以身作则的极端表现。就是说，我希望我的团队努力工作。与其告诉他们要努力工作，不如我以身作则，每天工作18个小时。我要向人们展示如何完成大量工单。但随后公司开始发展壮大。他们也有将大量工作分配给其他人的正常不适感。所以公司不断发展，工单量持续上升，现在他们必须每天工作19个小时，然后是20个小时，这显然行不通。但他们不会停下来招聘人员，因为他们认为，如果我停下来，哪怕只有一天，我们就会在工单处理上落后。在这种情况下摆脱英雄模式的唯一方法就是说，你知道吗？我们会在工单处理上落后两到三周，因为我要离开。我要再招聘三名支持团队成员，而且我已经根据我们的增长率计算出这会持续这么长时间。下次我不会再犯同样的错误。我会提前行动并再次招聘。但你实际上必须做出权衡。

You actually have to say, you know what? I need to hire more people and we're going to get behind on other stuff. That is the right answer. The wrong answer is to stay in hero mode until you burnout, which is what most people do.

实际上你必须说，你知道吗？我需要雇佣更多的人，这样我们在其他事情上就会落后一些。这才是正确的答案。错误的答案是继续保持英雄模式直到精疲力尽，这正是大多数人的做法。

Third mistake: bad delegation. Most founders have not managed people before and they certainly haven't managed managers. The bad way you delegate is you say, "Hey employee, we need to do this big thing. You go off and research it. Come back to me with all the data and the trade-offs, I'll make a decision and tell it to you, and then you'll go off and implement it." That's how most founders delegate, and that does not make people feel good and it certainly doesn't scale.

第三个错误：糟糕的授权方式。大多数创始人之前没有管理过人员，他们肯定也没有管理过管理者。糟糕的授权方式是你说："嘿，员工，我们需要做这件大事。你去研究一下。带着所有的数据和权衡方案回来找我，我会做决定并告诉你，然后你去执行。"这就是大多数创始人的授权方式，这既不会让人感觉良好，也肯定无法扩展。

A subtle difference but really important is to say, "Hey, you're really smart, that's why I hired you. You go off, here are the things to think about, here's what I think, but you make this decision. I totally trust you, and let me know what you decide." That's the delegation that actually works.

一个微妙但非常重要的区别是说："嘿，你真的很聪明，这就是我雇佣你的原因。你去吧，这些是需要考虑的事情，这是我的想法，但由你来做出这个决定。我完全信任你，告诉我你的决定。"这才是真正有效的授权方式。

I think because Steve Jobs was able to get away with the former and make every decision himself, and people just put up with it. And every founder thinks they're the next Steve Jobs. A lot of people try this. But for 99.9% of people, the second method here works a lot better.

我认为因为史蒂夫·乔布斯能够采用前一种方式并且自己做出每一个决定，而人们只能忍受。每个创始人都认为自己是下一个史蒂夫·乔布斯。很多人尝试这样做。但对于99.9%的人来说，第二种方法效果要好得多。

And then the fourth area is just a personal organization one. When you are working on product, you don't actually need to be that organized in terms of how you run a company, and how you talk to people about what they're working on. But if you fail to get your own personal organization system right, where you can keep track in some way of what you need to do, and what everybody else is

然后第四个领域是个人组织方面。当你专注于产品时，你实际上不需要在如何运营公司以及如何与人们讨论他们的工作内容方面那么有条理。但如果你未能建立正确的个人组织系统，无法以某种方式跟踪你需要做的事情以及其他人正在

where you can keep track in some way of what you need to do, and what everybody else is

That will come back to bite you, so developing this early as the company begins to scale is really important. Two other things that we hear again and again from our founders, they wished they had done earlier. And that is simply writing down how you do things and why you do things. These two things, the how and the why, are really important. I mean early there is you just tell everyone, employee, when you're sitting around, having lunch or dinner. This is how we think about building products, this is how we push production, this is how we handle customer support, whatever. As you get bigger, you can't keep doing that. And if you don't do it, someone else is just going to say it. But if you write it down, and put it up on a Wiki or whatever, that every employee reads, you as the founder get to basically write the law. And if you write this down it will become law in the company. And if you make everyone read this as the company hires 100 and then 1,000 employees, people will read this and say, all right, that's how we do things. If you don't do it, it will be like random oral tradition of whatever the hiring manager or their best friend that they make at their first week in the company tells them. So writing down how you do things and the why? The why is the culture of values. Brian Chesky talked about this really well. Every founder I know wishes that they'd written down both of these, the how and the why, earlier.

这会反过来困扰你，所以在公司开始扩张时尽早建立这一点非常重要。另外两件事是我们从创始人那里反复听到的，他们希望自己早点做。那就是简单地写下你做事的方式和原因。这两件事，即方法和原因，非常重要。我的意思是早期你只是告诉每个人，员工，当你们坐在一起吃午饭或晚饭时。这是我们思考产品构建的方式，这是我们推进生产的方式，这是我们处理客户支持的方式等等。随着公司规模扩大，你不能一直这样做。如果你不这样做，别人就会说出来。但如果你把它写下来，放在维基或任何地方，让每个员工阅读，作为创始人，你基本上就是在制定法律。如果你把这些写下来，它就会成为公司的法律。如果公司在招聘100名甚至1000名员工时让每个人都阅读这些，人们会阅读并说，好的，这就是我们的做事方式。如果你不这样做，就会变成随机的口头传统，由招聘经理或他们在公司第一周认识的最好的朋友告诉他们。所以写下你做事的方式和原因？原因就是价值观文化。Brian Chesky对此讲得很好。我认识的每位创始人都希望自己能更早写下这两点，即方法和原因。

doing, and then this becomes what happens. I think it's one of the highest leverage things that you can do that people don't. All right. Next area, HR. HR is another thing that most people correctly ignore in the first phase of a startup because again, it's not writing code. It's not talking to users. But it's a huge mistake to continue to ignore it. And the reason that I think most founders ignore it is they have in their mind this idea of, like TV sitcom HR, you know, awfulness. But it doesn't have to slow you down. Actually, it speeds you up. Most founders will say, out of one side of their mouth, people are our most important asset. And, the other side, we don't want any HR. So, what they mean is, we don't want HR. We don't want, like, the bad kind of TV HR. What good HR means is a few things. A clearer structure, which Charlie talked about. You know, a path for people about how they can evolve their careers? Most important, one of the most important things is performance feedback. Again, this happens organically early on, people know how they're doing. As the company gets to 25, 30, 45 people, that gets lost and it doesn't have to be complex. It can be super simple but there should be a way that it happens and it should be frequent. You know, people need to hear pretty quickly how they're doing? And it should tie, you know, if they're doing badly to a way you get them out of the company or if they're doing well it should there should be a clear path to how this ties to compensation. And that's the next thing.

这样做，然后这就变成了实际发生的情况。我认为这是你能做而大多数人不会做的高杠杆事情之一。好的，下一个领域，人力资源。人力资源是大多数人在创业初期正确忽略的另一件事，因为它不是写代码，也不是与用户交流。但继续忽略它是一个巨大的错误。我认为大多数创始人忽略它的原因是他们脑海中有那种情景喜剧里糟糕的人力资源形象。但它不必拖慢你的进度。实际上，它能加速你的发展。大多数创始人会一边说员工是我们最重要的资产，另一边又说我们不想要任何人力资源。所以他们的意思是，我们不想要那种糟糕的电视里的人力资源。良好的人力资源意味着几件事：更清晰的结构，正如查理谈到的；为员工提供职业发展路径；最重要的是绩效反馈。这在早期自然发生，员工知道自己的表现如何。当公司发展到25、30、45人时，这种情况就会消失，而且它不必复杂。它可以非常简单，但应该有固定的方式和频率。员工需要快速了解自己的表现如何？如果表现不佳，应该有让他们离开公司的途径；如果表现良好，应该有明确的与薪酬挂钩的路径。这就是接下来要谈的事情。

In the early days of a startup, people's compensation is whatever they negotiate with the founder, and it's all over the place. As you grow, it feels hopelessly corporate, but it really is worth putting in place these compensation bands. So a midlevel engineer is in this range, a senior engineer's in this range. Here's how you move from this to this, and it keeps things really fair. Someday everyone will find out what everyone else is compensated. If it's all over the place, it will be a complete meltdown disaster. If you put these bands in place early, it will at least be fair. It will also save you a lot of crazy negotiation.

在创业初期，员工的薪酬完全取决于他们与创始人的谈判结果，而且差异很大。随着公司发展，制定薪酬等级制度虽然感觉非常企业化，但确实值得建立。中级工程师在这个范围内，高级工程师在那个范围内。这是你如何从这个级别晋升到那个级别的方法，这样能保持公平。总有一天大家会发现彼此的薪酬水平。如果薪酬差异过大，将会造成彻底的灾难性后果。如果你早期就建立这些薪酬等级，至少能保证公平。这也能为你节省大量繁琐的谈判。

One thing that I think is really important when it comes to HR is equity. Most people get this right now for the early employees, they give them a lot of equity. But I think you should continue to give a lot of equity all the way through. And this is one place that your investors will always give you bad advice. I think, not YC, but all other investors give bad advice here, most do. You should be giving out a lot of equity to your employees. Now, this dilutes everyone, right? This dilutes you as the founder and the investors equally. For some reason, founders usually understand this is good, but investors are very shortsighted and don't want to dilute themselves. So they'll fight you over every equity grant. But we've seen a lot of data at YC now, and the most successful companies, and the ones where the investors do the best, end up giving a lot of stock out to employees.

在人力资源方面，我认为股权分配非常重要。现在大多数人都明白要给早期员工大量股权。但我认为你应该在整个发展过程中持续给予大量股权。而在这方面，你的投资者总是会给你糟糕的建议。我认为，除了YC之外，几乎所有其他投资者在这方面都会给出糟糕的建议，大多数都是如此。你应该向员工发放大量股权。这确实会稀释每个人的股份，对吧？这同样会稀释创始人和投资者的股份。出于某种原因，创始人通常理解这是有益的，但投资者往往目光短浅，不愿稀释自己的股份。因此他们会为每一笔股权授予与你争执。但我们在YC看到了大量数据，最成功的公司，以及投资者表现最好的公司，最终都向员工发放了大量股票。

Year after year after year, so I tell founders they should think about for the next ten years they're going to be giving out 3 to 5% of the company every year, because the company just gets bigger and bigger. So the individual grants get smaller, but in aggregate, it's a lot of stock. I think this is really important to do if you value your people, you should be doing this. Specifically, you need to do this with refresher grants and you should get a plan in place for this early. I think you never want an employee in a place where they vested three out of their four years of stock and they start thinking about leaving. So you should always stay in front of people's vesting schedules and plan early where you have refresher grants in place. There are a lot of new structures that people have been using here. I personally like six year, big grants, but six years investing because I think these companies just take a while to build. There's Pyramid Vesting where you back weight someone's grant, so in year four they get a lot more of the vesting than year one. There's a concept, different names for it, but something like continuous forward vesting, where people's grants are automatically reupped every year at the same number of shares. Whatever you decide, get an option management system in place at about this point. The normal way people do this is just someone keeps an Excel spreadsheet. I have seen mistakes that have cost employees or companies tens of millions of dollars because they didn't get this right. So there's really good option management systems or software.

年复一年，所以我告诉创始人，他们应该考虑在未来十年里每年分配公司3%到5%的股份，因为公司规模会越来越大。虽然个人授予的股份变少，但总体来看仍然是大量股权。我认为如果你重视员工，就应该这样做。具体来说，你需要通过补充授予来实现这一点，并且应该尽早制定相关计划。我认为你绝不希望员工在四年股权中已经归属了三年时开始考虑离职。因此你应该始终领先于员工的归属时间表，并提前规划好补充授予机制。这里有很多人们正在使用的新结构。我个人喜欢六年期的大额授予，但需要六年的投资期，因为我认为这些公司需要较长时间来建设。还有金字塔式归属，即向后加权员工的授予额度，这样第四年获得的归属份额远多于第一年。还有一个概念，名称各异，但类似于持续向前归属，即员工的授予份额每年会自动以相同股数续期。无论你决定采用哪种方式，大约在这个阶段就要建立期权管理系统。人们通常的做法是让某个人维护一个Excel电子表格。我见过因为处理不当而导致员工或公司损失数千万美元的错误。所以确实有很好的期权管理系统或软件。

You should get those in place around this point. The other sort of HR stuff to touch on is that there are a bunch of rules that change around 50 employees. Common examples are that you have to start sexual harassment training and diversity training; there are a bunch of others as well. But just put a little pin in your mind that when you cross 50 employees, there's a new set of HR rules that you have to comply with.

Monitor your team for burnout. Again, it's up to product-market fit. It's just a sprint; now it becomes a marathon. At this point, you actually don't want people to work a hundred hours a week forever. You want them to go on vacation. You want them to have new challenges and do new things. If you let the whole company get burned out all at once, that is often a company-ending thing.

This is also a good time to put in place a hiring process. Another thing that most founders regret is that they don't hire as soon as everything is working. I think you should hire a full-time recruiter. If you do this too early, that's bad because you'll hire too fast, and that usually implodes. But most founders get behind the ball on this.

There are a lot of other hiring process tips. For example, I think most companies, even until they get up to say 300 or 400 employees, should announce every offer on some internal mailing list or something before they make it, because about half the time you do that, someone in the company will know something good or bad about that candidate. The companies that I know that have instituted this have been really happy.

你应该在这个阶段把这些安排到位。另一类需要涉及的人力资源事务是，当员工数量达到50人左右时，会有很多规则发生变化。常见的例子包括必须开始进行性骚扰培训和多元化培训；此外还有许多其他规定。但请记住，当员工人数超过50人时，你就必须遵守一套新的人力资源规则。

关注团队成员的职业倦怠情况。这同样取决于产品市场匹配度。之前只是短跑，现在变成了马拉松。此时，你实际上不希望员工永远每周工作一百个小时。你希望他们去度假。你希望他们接受新挑战，尝试新事物。如果你让整个公司同时陷入倦怠，这往往会导致公司倒闭。

这也是建立招聘流程的好时机。大多数创始人后悔的另一件事是，他们没有在一切运转正常时立即招聘。我认为你应该招聘一名全职招聘人员。如果过早这样做，会导致招聘过快，这通常会造成内部崩溃。但大多数创始人在这一点上行动滞后。

还有很多其他招聘技巧。例如，我认为大多数公司，即使发展到300或400名员工，在发出录用通知前都应该在内部邮件列表或其他渠道公布每个录用意向，因为大约有一半的情况，公司里会有人对该候选人有正面或负面的了解。我所知道的实施这一制度的公司对此都非常满意。

It's also a good time to have a program in place to ramp up employees, so when someone starts, you know what their first week looks like. How do they get spun up? How do they learn everything they need to learn? Are they going to have a buddy that's going to help them think through everything about the company?

这也是建立员工培训计划的好时机，这样当新员工入职时，你就能清楚他们第一周的工作安排。他们如何快速适应？如何学习所有需要掌握的内容？他们是否会有一位伙伴帮助了解公司的方方面面？

Here's one that you actually do need to think about before the 12 to 24 month mark, which is diversity on the team. The most common place this comes up honestly is people that hire all guys on their engineering team for the first 15 or 20 people. At that point you get a culture in place that takes on a life of its own, and most founders that I've spoken to that have made this mistake regret it and they wished they had hired some diversity of perspective on the team early on. Engineering teams are not the only place where it comes up, but that's where you see it the most often. If you get this right early, you'll be able to grow the team much more quickly over the long-term.

这一点确实需要在12到24个月之前考虑，那就是团队的多样性。最常见的情况是，有些人在组建工程团队时，最初招聘的15到20名员工全是男性。到那时就会形成一种自我延续的文化氛围，我接触过的大多数犯过这个错误的创始人都对此感到后悔，他们希望当初能在团队中尽早引入多元化的视角。工程团队并非唯一会出现这种情况的地方，但这是最常出现的地方。如果你能尽早处理好这个问题，从长远来看，团队将能够更快地发展壮大。

The other thing to think about is what happens to your early employees. A common situation that happens is the company evolves fast, the early employees like you hire an engineer who is a really great engineer, but then as the engineering team grows you need a VP of Engineering. The early engineer wants to be the VP of Engineering, you can't do that, but you don't want the early employee to leave. They're an important part of the culture, they know a lot, people love them. I think you want to be very proactive about this and think about what's the path.

另一个需要考虑的是早期员工的职业发展。常见的情况是公司发展迅速，早期员工比如你招聘了一位非常优秀的工程师，但随着工程团队的壮大，你需要一位工程副总裁。这位早期工程师想要成为工程副总裁，但你无法满足这个要求，同时你又不希望早期员工离职。他们是企业文化的重要组成部分，他们了解很多情况，深受大家喜爱。我认为你需要对此非常积极主动，并思考他们的职业发展路径。

You want to think about what the path for your first 10 or 15 employees is going to be as the company grows. Then just talk to them about it very directly and be upfront. Sit them down and say you want to talk about where they want to see their career go inside of this company.

随着公司发展，你需要考虑前10到15名员工的发展路径。然后要非常直接地与他们沟通，坦诚相待。让他们坐下，说明你想讨论他们希望在这家公司如何发展自己的职业生涯。

Company productivity is something you don't need to think about in the early days because small teams are naturally productive most of the time. But as you grow, the productivity goes down with the square of the number of employees if you don't make an effort. It's like connections between nodes where every pair of people adds communication overhead. If you don't start thinking about the systems you're going to put in place when the company has 25 to 50 people to stay productive as you grow, things will grind to a halt faster than you can imagine.

公司生产力在早期阶段无需过多考虑，因为小团队在大多数时候自然具有生产力。但随着公司发展，如果不采取相应措施，生产力会随着员工数量的平方而下降。这就像节点之间的连接，每增加一对人员就会增加沟通开销。如果你不在公司发展到25到50人时就开始考虑建立相应体系来保持生产力，事情停滞的速度会超出你的想象。

The single word that matters most to keep the company productive as it grows is alignment. The reason companies become unproductive is people are either not on the same page and don't know what the same priorities are, or they're actively working against each other, which is obviously worse. But if you can keep the entire company aligned in the same direction, you'll have won well over half of the battle. The way to start with this is just a very clear roadmap and goals. Everyone in the company should know what the roadmap for the next three or six months, or a year looks like, depending on where the company is in its life cycle.

随着公司发展，保持生产力最重要的一个词就是"对齐"。公司变得低效的原因是员工要么没有达成共识、不清楚相同的优先事项，要么在相互对抗，后者显然更糟。但如果你能让整个公司朝着同一个方向对齐，你就已经赢得了大半的胜利。实现这一点的起点就是制定清晰的路线图和目标。公司中的每个人都应该清楚未来三到六个月或一年的路线图是什么样子，具体取决于公司处于生命周期的哪个阶段。

A classic test that I love to give is if I walk into a company beginning to struggle with these scaling issues, I'll ask the founders if I walked around and polled.

我喜欢做的一个经典测试是：当我走进一家开始面临这些扩展问题的公司时，我会问创始人，如果我四处走动并进行调查。

If I walked around and polled ten random employees and asked them what the top three goals for the company are right now, would they all say the same thing? A 100% of the time, the founder says yes, of course they would. And I'd go do it, and 100% of the time, no two employees even say the same three top three goals in order. Founders can never believe it, because they're like well I announced that in all hands like three months ago what our goals were going to be, and how can they not remember? But it's really important to keep reiterating the message about the roadmap and the goals, and almost no founder does this enough. And if you do it, the company will say, all right, these are our goals, we understand them, we're going to get them done, I know self-organize around that. But if people don't know what the roadmap of their goals are it won't happen. We already talked about figuring out your values early, but I want to reiterate that because that also really helps the company make the right decisions. If everyone knows what the framework to decide is, they'll make hopefully the same decisions if they're smart people. You want to continue to be run by great products and not process for its own sake. This is a fine, fine line, because you do need to put some process in place, but you never want to put process in place that rewards the process. The focus has to always be on great product. One easy way to do this that a lot of companies try is they just say, we're going to ship something every day, and if you do that, there's at least a continued focus on delivery.

如果我随机询问十名员工，问他们公司当前最重要的三个目标是什么，他们会给出相同的答案吗？百分之百的情况下，创始人都会说当然会。但当我实际去做时，百分之百的情况下，甚至没有两名员工能按顺序说出相同的三个首要目标。创始人总是难以置信，因为他们觉得三个月前已经在全员会议上宣布过我们的目标了，员工怎么可能不记得？但持续重申路线图和目标信息确实非常重要，而几乎没有创始人在这方面做得足够充分。如果你这样做了，公司会说：好的，这些是我们的目标，我们理解了，我们会完成它们，我知道要围绕这些目标自我组织。但如果人们不知道自己的目标路线图是什么，这一切就不会发生。我们之前已经讨论过尽早明确价值观的重要性，但我想重申这一点，因为这确实有助于公司做出正确决策。如果每个人都知道决策框架是什么，只要他们是聪明人，就有望做出相同的决定。你希望继续由优秀的产品驱动，而不是为了流程而流程。这是一个非常微妙的界限，因为你确实需要建立一些流程，但你绝不应该建立那些只为流程本身服务的流程。重点必须始终放在优秀的产品上。很多公司尝试的一个简单方法是：他们直接说，我们要每天发布产品，如果你这样做，至少能保持对交付的持续关注。

Transparency and rhythm in how you communicate are really important. Most founders wait way too long on these, but having a management meeting every week with just the people that report directly to the founder or the CEO is critical. All hands meetings are also important, though I'm not quite sure how often is optimal for those. At least once a month where you go through the results and the roadmap with the entire company is really important. Doing a plan every quarter of what we're going to accomplish over the next three months and how that fits into our goals for the year also becomes really important.

沟通的透明度和节奏非常重要。大多数创始人在这些方面等待得太久，但每周与直接向创始人或CEO汇报的人员举行管理会议至关重要。全员会议也很重要，尽管我不太确定最佳频率是多少。至少每月一次与整个公司一起回顾成果和路线图非常重要。每个季度制定未来三个月要完成什么以及如何与年度目标相匹配的计划也变得非常重要。

Where they'll take their best people for a weekend to a cabin in the woods or somewhere and just talk about strategy. If you look at the examples of this, most companies fail here. Most companies do one great thing where the founder just pushes to get it done and then don't innovate that well on follow on products. And it really takes founders that think about how I'm going to do this second thing, this really hard thing, to get something like an Apple that can churn out great products for 30 or 40 years, or longer.

他们会把最优秀的人才带到林间小屋或其他地方度周末，专门讨论战略问题。如果你看看这方面的例子，大多数公司都在这里失败了。大多数公司只做了一件伟大的事情，创始人推动完成了它，但在后续产品上却没有很好地创新。真正需要的是那些思考如何完成第二件事、这件真正困难的事情的创始人，才能打造出像苹果这样的公司，能够在30年、40年甚至更长时间里持续推出优秀产品。

All right, these are super tactical mechanics. This is definitely to just put on a list and remember these things for later. All right, in the early days, people basically ignore all accounting and they have, maybe if they're lucky, a shoebox full of receipts. They certainly don't have anything that looks like a financial report. This is a good time to get it in place when things are working, say, month 18 or whatever.

好的，这些都是非常战术性的机制。这绝对应该列个清单，以后记住这些事情。好的，在早期阶段，人们基本上会忽略所有会计工作，如果幸运的话，他们可能只有一个装满收据的鞋盒。他们肯定没有任何看起来像财务报表的东西。当业务运转良好时，比如第18个月左右，这是建立会计体系的好时机。

You can do this with an outsourced person. Just say, you know what? We want to get our books in order. We want to start getting audits every year. We want to start a relationship with an accounting firm. Easy to do, definitely worth it. This is also a good time to collect your legal documents because it's easy to fix things now.

你可以外包给专业人士来做。就说：你知道吗？我们想要整理账目。我们想要开始每年进行审计。我们想要与会计师事务所建立关系。这很容易做到，绝对值得。这也是收集法律文件的好时机，因为现在修复问题很容易。

So, if you actually assign someone to go through and collect every agreement the company has ever signed, then when your landlord tries to screw you out of your lease and no-one can find the lease, which happens like half the time, someone will be able to find it. Also, you're almost certainly missing something. Some employee didn't sign their PIIA or whatever and you'll find it now. It's easy to fix now. It gets really hard to fix later.

所以，如果你真的指派某人去收集公司签署过的每一份协议，那么当房东试图在租约上坑你而没人能找到租约时——这种情况大约有一半时间会发生——就会有人能找到它。而且，你几乎肯定遗漏了一些东西。有些员工没有签署保密协议之类的文件，你现在就能发现。现在修复很容易，以后修复就会变得非常困难。

It gets really hard to fix in the middle of your next round of financing. So, again, this is time to bring a little bit of order to chaos.

在下一轮融资过程中进行修正会变得非常困难。因此，现在是时候给混乱带来一些秩序了。

FF stock is a special class of stock for founders that the founders can sell in a later round, without messing up the common-stock valuation. It used to be that most people set this up right when they started the company.

FF股是专门为创始人设立的特殊类别股份，创始人可以在后续融资轮次中出售这些股份，而不会影响普通股的估值。过去大多数人都是在公司创立时就设立这种股份。

Founders fund sort of popularizes it, which is why it's called FF stock. But it became a really bad signal, right? Founders that were obsessed with their own personal liquidity when the company had nothing turned out to fail most of the time.

创始人基金某种程度上推广了这种做法，这也是它被称为FF股的原因。但这变成了一个非常糟糕的信号，对吧？那些在公司一无所有时就过分关注个人流动性的创始人，大多数最终都失败了。

And so investors learn that if founders pushed on this in the seed round it was a very, very bad sign. Most founders don't actually want to sell stock until the company is worth a billion dollars or something like that.

因此投资者认识到，如果创始人在种子轮就坚持这个要求，那是个非常糟糕的迹象。大多数创始人实际上并不想出售股份，除非公司估值达到十亿美元左右。

So, I think you can actually safely set this up after things start working, in the next financial round, and then you can sell it two, three, four years down the road. But it's a good thing to remember by about the time you get to the B round.

所以，我认为你可以在业务开始运转后的下一轮融资中安全地设立这个机制，然后可以在未来两三年出售这些股份。但最好在进入B轮融资时记住这件事。

IP, trademarks and patents, actually just IP and trademarks. So, you have 12 months after you announce something if you want to patent it. And if you miss that window, it's very hard to do.

知识产权、商标和专利，实际上主要是知识产权和商标。如果你想要为某个东西申请专利，在公布后有12个月的时间。如果错过这个窗口期，就很难再申请了。

So, 11 months after you launch, or first publicly talk about what you're doing, is a good time to file provisional patents. We recommend people just file provisional patents.

因此，在发布产品或首次公开谈论你所做事情后的第11个月，是提交临时专利申请的好时机。我们建议人们直接提交临时专利申请。

All that does is just hold your place in line at the patent office and it gives you another year to decide if you want to patent something or not.

这样做的作用只是在专利局排队占位，并给你额外一年的时间来决定是否要为某个东西申请专利。

It only costs about $1000. It takes way less effort than a full patent. And most of the time you'll know whether or not you need full patent a year later. But if you just do this one step, you'll at least have the option. It's also a good time to file trademarks for the U.S. and major international markets. Again, if you don't do this at this stage, most people end up regretting it. And while you're at it, a good time to grab all the domains.

这只需要花费大约1000美元。比起完整的专利申请，所需精力要少得多。大多数情况下，一年后你就会知道自己是否需要完整的专利。但如果你只做这一步，至少你还有选择的余地。这也是为美国和主要国际市场注册商标的好时机。再次强调，如果你不在这个阶段做这件事，大多数人最终都会后悔。趁此机会，也是注册所有域名的好时机。

FP&A is a good time to also hire an investment banker or someone else. If it's just someone internal to the company, you end up paying way less money and take literally half the dilution. So, I think this is one of those slightly non-obvious optimizations that people just fail to make. Tax structuring is another thing. Once things are working, it would be worth spending a little bit of time thinking about how you set up the tax structure for the company. I confess I don't know a lot about the details here because I just find it personally really boring. But if you assign all the IP to some corporation in Ireland that licenses it back to the U.S. corporation, you end up paying no corporate tax. I know you can only do that relatively early on. This ends up being a huge issue for companies that don't do it but compete with companies that do. Once they're big public companies, that's worth doing.

财务规划与分析阶段也是聘请投资银行家或其他外部人员的好时机。如果只使用公司内部人员，你最终支付的费用会少得多，股权稀释也几乎只有一半。所以我认为这是人们常常忽略的那些不太明显的优化之一。税务架构是另一件事。当公司运营稳定后，花点时间考虑如何设置公司的税务架构是值得的。我承认对这方面的细节了解不多，因为我个人觉得这很无聊。但如果你把所有知识产权分配给爱尔兰的某家公司，然后授权给美国公司使用，你最终就不用缴纳公司税。我知道这只能在相对早期的时候操作。对于那些没有这样做却要与这样做的公司竞争的企业来说，这最终会成为重大问题。一旦它们成为大型上市公司，这样做就很有价值。

A lot of people throughout the class have talked about your own psychology as a founder. This also will go on and on as you get more and more successful, and you just have to make peace with this early. But if you don't, it will bother you all the way through. This is also a good time to start thinking about how long of a journey this is going to be. Very few founders think long term. Most founders think kind of a year in advance. Because so few people make an actual long term commitment to what they're building, the ones that do have a huge advantage. They're in a very rarefied class, and so this is a good time to sit around with your cofounders and decide that we're going to work on this for a very long time. And we're going to build a strategy that assumes that we're going to be doing this for the next ten years. Just thinking that way alone is probably a very high leverage thing you can do for success. Take vacation. Another common thing that we see is founders will run their business for three or four years, without ever taking more than a day of vacation. And that works for like a year, or two years, or something like that. It really leads to nasty burnout if you don't do it. Losing focus is another way that founders get off track. I actually think this is a symptom of burnout. When you get really burned out on running the business, you want to do easier things, or sort of more gratifying things.

很多同学在课程中都谈到过作为创始人的心理状态。随着你越来越成功，这种情况也会持续不断，你必须尽早接受这一点。但如果你不接受，它会一直困扰你。这也是开始思考这段旅程将会有多长的好时机。很少有创始人会从长远考虑。大多数创始人只提前考虑一年左右。因为很少有人对他们正在构建的事业做出真正的长期承诺，那些这样做的人拥有巨大优势。他们属于非常稀有的群体，所以这是与联合创始人坐下来决定我们将长期致力于此的好时机。我们将制定一个假设我们将在未来十年继续做这件事的战略。仅仅这样思考本身，可能就是你能为成功做的高杠杆事情。休假。我们看到的另一个常见现象是，创始人会经营他们的企业三四年，却从未休过超过一天的假期。这种方式可能持续一年、两年左右。如果你不这样做，真的会导致严重的倦怠。失去专注是创始人偏离轨道的另一种方式。我实际上认为这是倦怠的症状。当你对经营企业感到非常疲惫时，你会想做更容易的事情，或者更令人满足的事情。

You want to go to conferences and have people tell you how great you are. You want to do all these things that are not actually building the business. The most common post-YC failure case for the companies we fund is that they're incredibly focused during YC on their company, and then after, they start doing a lot of other things. They advise companies, they go to conferences, whatever. Focus is what made you successful in the first place. There are a lot of reasons people lose focus, but fight against that really, really hard.

你想去参加会议，听人们夸赞你有多棒。你想做所有这些实际上并不能建立业务的事情。我们资助的公司中最常见的YC后失败案例是，他们在YC期间非常专注于自己的公司，但之后就开始做很多其他事情。他们给其他公司提供建议，参加各种会议等等。专注是让你最初成功的原因。人们失去专注有很多原因，但要非常努力地对抗这种情况。

As you start to do well, you will start to get a bunch of potential acquirers sniffing around. It's very gratifying, and you think, "Wow, I can be so rich and that'd be so cool." Negotiations feel really fun. This is one of the biggest killers of companies - that they entertain acquisition conversations. You distract yourself, and you get demoralized if it doesn't happen. If an offer does come in and it's really low, you've already mentally thought that you're done, and so you take the offer.

当你开始做得不错时，会有一批潜在的收购方开始关注。这非常令人满足，你会想："哇，我可以变得很富有，那太酷了。"谈判感觉真的很有趣。这是公司最大的杀手之一——他们参与收购谈判。你会分散自己的注意力，如果收购没有发生，你会士气低落。如果真的收到报价但价格很低，你已经在心理上认为自己完蛋了，于是接受了这个报价。

As a general rule, don't start any acquisition conversation unless you're willing to sell for a pretty low number. Don't ever just check it hoping that you're going to have the one miracle high offer. If that's going to happen, you'll know because they'll just make you a big offer before you can meet them. This is a big company killer.

作为一般规则，除非你愿意以相当低的价格出售，否则不要开始任何收购对话。永远不要只是试探性地接触，希望会出现奇迹般的高报价。如果这种情况会发生，你会知道，因为他们会在你见到他们之前就给你一个大报价。这是公司的一大杀手。

Just as a reminder to everybody, the thing that kills startups at some level is the founders giving up.

提醒大家，在某种程度上扼杀初创公司的是创始人的放弃。

So sometimes you should quit. But if you mismanage your own psychology and you quit when you shouldn't, that is what kills companies. That is the sort of final death in most of these startups. If you can manage your own psychology in a way that you don't quit, don't go to a place where you need to quit or give up on the startup, you'll be in a far better place.

Marketing and PR is something that we tell companies to ignore for a long time. Everyone thinks in the early days that the press is going to be what saves them. We tell them all the time it doesn't work that way. Press is not what's going to save your startup. But as you start to be successful, this is something that the founders themselves need to spend time on. Once your product is working, switch from not caring about this to caring about it a little bit.

The two most important things for the founders to do: figure out the key messaging yourselves, never outsource this to your head of marketing or PR firm. Founders have to figure out what the message of the company is going to be. Once you set that, it kind of sticks. It's very hard to change this once the press decides how they're going to talk about you. The other thing is getting to know key journalists yourself. PR firms will always try to prevent you from doing this because they need to have a reason to exist. They say they're going to handle the relationship with the journalist and just bring you in for interviews.

有时候你确实应该放弃。但如果你管理不好自己的心态，在不该放弃的时候放弃了，那才是导致公司倒闭的原因。这就是大多数初创企业最终消亡的方式。如果你能管理好自己的心态，做到不轻易放弃，不让自己陷入需要放弃或退出创业的境地，你的处境会好得多。

市场营销和公关是我们长期以来建议公司忽略的事情。在早期阶段，每个人都认为媒体会拯救他们。我们一直告诉他们事实并非如此。媒体不会拯救你的初创公司。但当你开始取得成功时，创始人自己就需要在这方面投入时间。一旦你的产品开始正常运作，就要从完全不关心转变为稍微关注一下。

创始人需要做的最重要的两件事：自己确定关键信息传递策略，永远不要把这个工作外包给市场总监或公关公司。创始人必须自己确定公司的核心信息是什么。一旦你确定了这一点，它就会固定下来。一旦媒体决定了如何报道你，就很难改变这一点。另一件事是亲自结识关键记者。公关公司总是试图阻止你这样做，因为他们需要存在的理由。他们会说他们会处理与记者的关系，只是在需要采访时让你参与。

No journalist wants to talk to a PR flack, ever. They're so much more happy to just hear from a founder. I think the biggest PR hack you can do is to not hire a PR firm. Just pick three or four journalists that you develop really close relationships with, that like you, that understand you, that you get. And then you contact them yourself. They will cover every story you ever give them, and they'll actually pay attention, get to know you and care about the company. This is so much better than the normal strategy of having a PR firm blast 200 contacts that never read their e-mails, with every piece of news.

从来没有记者愿意与公关人员交谈。他们更乐意直接听取创始人的意见。我认为你能做的最大的公关技巧就是不聘请公关公司。只需选择三到四位记者，与他们建立真正密切的关系，让他们喜欢你、理解你、了解你。然后你自己联系他们。他们会报道你提供的每一个故事，并且会真正关注你、了解你并关心公司。这比让公关公司向200个从不阅读邮件的联系人发送每一条新闻的常规策略要好得多。

This is something that I think is important to start doing. This is also the time in a company when business development starts to matter. In the early days you can basically ignore anything that would be like doing deals, except maybe fund raising and sales. This is the time when they're important. Everything, or many things that you do, like even fundraising, falls under the category of doing deals.

我认为这是开始做的重要事情。这也是公司中业务发展开始变得重要的时期。在早期阶段，你基本上可以忽略任何类似做交易的事情，除了融资和销售。这是它们变得重要的时期。你所做的一切，或者很多事情，甚至包括融资，都属于做交易的范畴。

Here's my one-minute crash course on this. There are five points that I think are important to understand here. We've talked about this a lot. Nothing will serve, nothing will matter if you don't build a great product. So assume that you've done this before you go try and get anyone to do anything with you. Developing a personal connection with anyone you're trying to do any sort of big deal with is really important. For whatever reason, most founders fail to do this, or many founders fail to do this. But no one wants to feel like they're this transactional.

这是我对此的一分钟速成课程。这里有五个要点我认为很重要。我们已经多次讨论过这个问题。如果你没有打造出优秀的产品，一切都将毫无意义。所以假设在你试图让任何人配合你做任何事情之前，你已经做到了这一点。与你试图进行任何重大交易的人建立个人联系非常重要。无论出于什么原因，大多数创始人都未能做到这一点，或者许多创始人都未能做到这一点。但没有人希望感觉自己只是这种交易关系。

You have to actually care about them and what they're going to get out of this. Competitive dynamics, so this is like basic principle of negotiation. Most funders learn this the first time in fundraising but it actually matters for everything. The way you get deals done, and the way you get good terms, is to have a competitive situation. If you don't do this deal with party A, you're going to do it with party B. It's not always an option, but it usually is, and this is the single thing that makes deals happen and makes deals move. Tyler talked about persistence the last lecture so I won't hit on that again too much, other than to say, you have to go beyond your comfort point here, most of the time as a founder. The fifth point is you have to ask for what you want. This is another thing, I still have trouble with this, and certainly most of the founders we do. If you want something to deal, just ask for it. Most of the time, you won't get laughed out of the room and you might get it. But you have to be like, at some point you actually have to say, this is what I'd like you to do. Even if it feels aggressive or an overreach, or whatever.

你必须真正关心他们以及他们能从这件事中获得什么。竞争动态，这就像是谈判的基本原则。大多数筹资者第一次在筹资时学到这一点，但这实际上对一切都重要。达成交易和获得良好条款的方式，就是创造竞争局面。如果你不与A方达成这笔交易，你就会与B方达成。这并不总是一个选择，但通常都是，而这是促成交易和推动交易的唯一因素。泰勒在上次讲座中谈到了坚持，所以我不会过多重复，只想说，作为创始人，大多数时候你必须超越自己的舒适区。第五点是，你必须提出你想要的东西。这是另一件事，我仍然在这方面有困难，当然我们接触的大多数创始人也是如此。如果你想达成某件事，就直接提出要求。大多数时候，你不会被嘲笑出房间，而且你可能会得到它。但你必须做到，在某个时刻你实际上必须说，这就是我希望你做的事情。即使感觉咄咄逼人或越权，或其他什么。

You're using them to get distribution for your product, or to raise money, or whatever. So figuring out some way to actually care about this person and care about what you're doing with them. You have to in your own mind not just view them as a one-off transaction. I drew this on a business card or something for another founder that was starting a company. Then I saw it once and took a picture of it because I thought it was such a good summary. What he had tried to draw here was the Y Combinator process as he remembered it. I love it because it's so simple, and it looks so doable when it's written on a business card. You're trying to find product market fit. You're trying to build a product, and you're trying to close the gap between those two gears. The only way to do that is to go off and meet the people. You cannot do this without getting really, really close to your users. Then he drew this graph on a whiteboard at YC. It's the graph of how adoption goes for a new company. So you launch in the press, you get a huge spike. It falls off to nothing. At some point, things look like they're going to completely die and kind of dip below the x-axis. They recover a little bit. You have this long, long, long trough of sorrow before things work. In Airbnb's case, it was 1,000 days before the graph started ticking upward. You have these wiggles of false hope, and then finally, things start to grow three years later. So starting a startup ends up being this very long process. It can be really rewarding. It's definitely long, but it is doable. And that's what I love about that drawing. With that, I think I have about ten minutes left. I can answer questions on this, or anything else in the course that we've covered.

你利用他们来为产品获取分销渠道，或筹集资金，或做其他事情。因此要找到某种方式真正关心这个人，关心你与他们合作的内容。在你自己心中，不能仅仅将他们视为一次性交易。我把这个画在了一张名片之类的东西上，给另一位正在创业的创始人。后来我又看到它一次，就拍了张照片，因为我觉得这是个很好的总结。他试图在这里描绘的是他记忆中的Y Combinator流程。我喜欢它是因为它如此简单，当写在名片上时看起来如此可行。你正在努力寻找产品市场契合点。你正在努力打造产品，并试图缩小这两个齿轮之间的差距。唯一的方法就是走出去接触人群。如果不真正贴近你的用户，你无法做到这一点。然后他在YC的白板上画了这张图。这是一张展示新公司用户采纳过程的图表。你在媒体上发布，获得巨大的峰值。然后它跌落到零。在某个时刻，情况看起来会完全失败，甚至跌至x轴以下。它们会稍微恢复一些。在事情好转之前，你会经历漫长、漫长、漫长的悲伤低谷。以Airbnb为例，图表开始向上攀升前经历了1000天。你会经历这些虚假希望的波动，然后最终，事情开始增长，那已是三年之后。所以创业最终是一个极其漫长的过程。它可能非常有回报。它确实漫长，但它是可行的。这就是我喜欢那幅画的原因。说到这里，我想我还有大约十分钟时间。我可以回答关于这个问题或课程中我们涉及的任何其他内容的提问。

If anyone has some thoughts on this, yes. You mentioned that diversity is important, but an earlier speaker said diversity wasn't important and you should just hire people that are very much like you. So the question is, how do you square the idea of diversity being important with earlier speakers saying you want people that are very similar? The difference is you want diversity of backgrounds, but you don't want diversity of vision. Companies get in trouble when they have people thinking very differently about what the company should be doing, or when people don't work well together. You don't want that. You do want to hire people that you know, that you trust, and that you can work with. But if everyone on the team comes from exactly the same background, you end up developing somewhat of a mono-culture which often causes problems down the road. Not always - some companies have been successful with that. So what we tell people is: hire people that you know and that you've worked with before, but try to hire people that are complementary and align towards the same goal, not people that are exactly the same, because you get a better skill set.

如果有人对此有什么想法，请说。你提到多样性很重要，但之前的演讲者说多样性并不重要，你应该只雇佣与你非常相似的人。那么问题是，你如何将多样性重要的观点与之前演讲者说想要非常相似的人这一说法协调起来？区别在于你需要背景的多样性，但不需要愿景的多样性。当公司里的人们对于公司应该做什么有非常不同的想法，或者人们不能很好地合作时，公司就会陷入困境。你不希望那样。你确实需要雇佣你认识、信任并且能够合作的人。但如果团队中的每个人都来自完全相同的背景，你最终会形成某种单一文化，这往往会在未来引发问题。并非总是如此——有些公司在这方面取得了成功。所以我们告诉人们的是：雇佣你认识并且以前合作过的人，但要尝试雇佣能够互补并朝着相同目标努力的人，而不是完全相同的人，因为这样你能获得更好的技能组合。

I write down my short term goals for that day. And so if I need to do something in like a week, I just flip forward seven pages and write it down, and then I also keep a list of every person and what they're working on, and what I need to tell them, and what I need to talk to them about, what we talked about last time. So every time I sit down with someone, I kind of have the full statement, a list of things for that person that works really well.

我会写下当天的短期目标。如果一周后需要做什么事情，我就往前翻七页写下来。然后我还保留着每个人的清单，包括他们在做什么，我需要告诉他们什么，我需要和他们谈什么，以及我们上次谈了什么。所以每次我和某人坐下来交谈时，我基本上都有完整的记录，一份针对那个人的事项清单，这种方法非常有效。

Most startups fail, and Silicon Valley almost goes too far in how much it loves failure. Failure still sucks. You should still try not to fail. And this whole thing of failure's great, I don't agree with. But it will happen to most people most of the time, and it's a very forgiving environment. As long as you are upfront about it, and ethical, and don't let anyone get into a bad situation. So, if you're failing, first of all, you should tell your investors. And, second of all, you should not totally run out of money. What you don't want is a blow-up with a bunch of debts that the company owe, and everyone showing up to work one day and the door being locked. You'll know when you're failing, you'll know when the company is, things just aren't going to work, and you should just tell your investors.

大多数初创公司都会失败，硅谷对失败的喜爱程度几乎有些过头了。失败仍然很糟糕。你仍然应该尽量避免失败。我不同意那种认为失败很伟大的观点。但失败在大多数时候会发生在大多数人身上，而且这是一个非常宽容的环境。只要你对此保持坦诚，遵守道德，不让任何人陷入困境。所以，如果你正在失败，首先，你应该告诉你的投资者。其次，你不应该完全耗尽资金。你不希望的是公司欠下一堆债务后突然崩溃，然后某天大家来上班时发现门被锁上了。你会知道自己什么时候在失败，你会知道公司什么时候不行了，事情就是无法继续下去，这时候你就应该告诉你的投资者。

[你要尽早告知大家。不要让他们感到意外。你也不希望员工在得知失业时受到打击。你应该以体面的方式关闭公司。帮助他们找工作。确保给予他们两到四周的遣散费，这样他们就不会面临现金流问题。所有这些都非常重要。]

[在上一批中，我认为下一批可能会增加。上一批我们资助的创始人中有41%出生在美国以外。来自30个不同的国家。是的，这是一个相当大的比例。]

[我仍然认为硅谷是最好的，优势非常明显。但我认为它终于可能开始有点减弱了。因为成本已经完全失控了。明确地说，如果我要创办公司，我仍然不会考虑其他地方。我仍然会选择硅谷。]

If anyone has some suggestions, I'd like to hear them. I think if you look at the data of companies over the last few years, Silicon Valley still wins by a lot. But Seattle, LA, lots of places outside the U.S., I think all of these make sense. When asked about specific places outside, I hesitate to make recommendations there because I haven't spent enough time in these cities to really have an intuitive feel. But you know as well as I do the common ones people talk about, startup hubs, and I just can't make a personal recommendation there.

如果有人有任何建议，我很乐意听取。我认为如果你查看过去几年公司的数据，硅谷仍然遥遥领先。但西雅图、洛杉矶，以及美国以外的许多地方，我认为这些都有道理。当被问及国外的具体地点时，我犹豫是否要提出建议，因为我在这些城市待的时间不够长，无法真正形成直观感受。但你也和我一样清楚人们常讨论的那些常见地点，创业中心，我只是无法给出个人推荐。

If anyone has some mistakes to make when you're shifting towards building your own company, I think I went through most of them here. I tried to put everything in here that I see people mess up most of the time.

如果有人想知道在转向创建自己公司的过程中会犯哪些错误，我认为我在这里已经涵盖了大部分。我试图把我看到人们最常犯的错误都放在这里。

Is there a way to get involved with YC before getting funded? No, and intentionally not. Actually I'll say the one thing you can do is if you work at a YC company. And then later apply, I think that definitely if you get a good recommendation from those founders will help with YC. So you know, working at a YC company helps. But there's not much you can do to help and that's intentional. Like there is no pre-startup in a way that there's pre-med. You should just focus on whatever you're doing. And when you start a startup, there's things like YC and others that are structured to help you. Most of the founders we fund, we don't know at all before we do it. You really don't need to get to know us or get involved. We're all good that way.

在被资助之前有没有办法参与YC？没有，而且是故意这样设计的。实际上，我想说你能做的一件事就是在YC公司工作。然后之后再申请，我认为如果你能从那些创始人那里得到好的推荐信，肯定会对申请YC有帮助。所以你知道，在YC公司工作是有帮助的。但你能做的帮助不多，这是有意为之的。就像没有预科创业项目，就像没有医学预科一样。你应该专注于你正在做的事情。当你开始创业时，有像YC和其他机构这样的组织来帮助你。我们资助的大多数创始人，在资助之前我们完全不认识。你真的不需要认识我们或参与进来。我们在这方面都做得很好。

There's a statistic saying it's now harder to get into YC than getting into Harvard. So I'm curious about the criteria that are used to pick startups. Does it change over time? The question is what criteria do we use to pick startups and has it gotten harder? Has it changed? The two things that we need to see are good founders and a good idea. Without both of those, we,

有统计数据显示现在进入YC比进入哈佛更难。所以我很好奇挑选初创公司的标准是什么？这些标准会随时间改变吗？问题是我们用什么标准来挑选初创公司，是否变得更难了？是否发生了变化？我们需要看到的两样东西是优秀的创始人和好的想法。没有这两样，我们，

we,

We won't fund a company, but that hasn't changed. That has always been the case. The applicant pool to YC has grown quite a bit, but most of the growth is people that shouldn't be starting start-ups anyway. They're probably doing it because it's sort of the cool thing now. If you're really passionate about an idea, and the idea is good, and you're smart and get things done, I still think you have a very reasonable shot at YC, even though the headline number is bigger.

我们不会资助一家公司，但这并没有改变。这一直都是我们的立场。YC的申请者数量增长了很多，但大部分增长来自于那些本来就不应该创业的人。他们可能只是因为现在创业看起来很酷才这么做。如果你真的对一个想法充满热情，而且这个想法很好，你又聪明且能完成任务，我仍然认为你在YC有相当不错的机会，尽管总体申请人数增加了。

I have a question related to Y Combinator's job in promoting partnership instead of combating. In fact, as an institutional investor, I actually met with a suite up at YC. In past periods, the hardware has things like you know, you guys have 180 companies every year jumping into the market. And it looks like it's hard to follow each of the YC companies anymore. Do you think that this will create some situation where some people will walk away from YC because they cannot follow such companies? The company has to be very polished and the founder has to be thinking over and over about ideas. Easy to access the capital.

我有一个关于Y Combinator在促进合作而非对抗方面工作的问题。事实上，作为机构投资者，我实际上在YC与一个团队会面过。在过去时期，硬件领域的情况是，你们每年有180家公司进入市场。现在看起来很难再跟踪每一家YC公司了。您认为这种情况是否会导致一些人因为无法跟踪这些公司而离开YC？公司必须非常完善，创始人必须反复思考各种想法。容易获得资本。

All right, so I think the question is do I think investors are going to fund less YC companies as we grow? No, definitely not. Like certainly the trend in this is the other way. We have more and more investors saying that, you know, half their portfolio's now YC companies. And they're looking forward to the day where it's three-quarters. No I don't think that's a problem at all. I think that is like so not on my top 100 problem list. The opposite of that maybe.

好的，我认为问题是随着我们的发展，投资者是否会减少对YC公司的投资？不，绝对不会。实际上趋势恰恰相反。我们有越来越多的投资者表示，他们投资组合中现在有一半是YC公司。他们期待着四分之三都是YC公司的那一天。不，我完全不认为这是个问题。这甚至不在我前100个问题清单上。可能情况正好相反。

When should a group of founders raise a seed fund or the first fund? This is a great question. I think that in general, it's nice to wait until you have the idea figured out and initial signs of promise before you raise money. Raising money puts some pressure on the company, some time pressure. And once you've raised money you can't be in this exploratory phase indefinitely, and you end up having to rush.

创始人团队应该在什么时候筹集种子基金或第一轮资金？这是个很好的问题。我认为一般来说，最好等到你把想法理清并看到初步成功迹象后再筹集资金。筹集资金会给公司带来一些压力，特别是时间压力。一旦你筹集了资金，就不能无限期地处于探索阶段，最终你不得不匆忙推进。

If you haven't raised money and your idea isn't working, you can pivot until you find what works. But if you raise money and your idea doesn't work, you're in trouble and have to pivot immediately. You end up pivoting to the first vaguely plausible idea, which is bad. If you can wait to raise outside capital until things are working or at least pointing in the right direction, you're much better off.

如果你没有融资且想法行不通，你可以不断调整直到找到可行方案。但如果你已经融资而想法失败，就会陷入困境并被迫立即转型。最终只能转向第一个看似可行的想法，这很糟糕。如果你能等到业务运转良好或至少方向正确时再寻求外部资金，情况会好得多。
