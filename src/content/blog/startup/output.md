I am good at only one thing: business. For the last 30 years, I built 19 companies and invested in 78 startups. People ask me every day to be their mentor and to help them, and they've even offered me £10,000 to help them just for one day in business. I don't want to charge people for help. I want to give you the knowledge for free. Today I'm going to give you everything you need to start a business, to grow a business, to maintain a business, and to sell a business. But if you can't stay on this video for 5 minutes without clicking off, I've got some news for you: you're probably not going to make it. I'm now going to list all the things I'm going to go through in the next 45 minutes to change your mindset, give you the tools you need to be successful, and hopefully create new pathways in your brain that give you the chance to be successful. The very thing that the education system does not want you to be is free: working for yourself, controlling your own destiny.

我只擅长一件事：商业。过去30年间，我创立了19家公司，投资了78家初创企业。每天都有人请我担任导师并提供帮助，他们甚至愿意支付1万英镑只为获得我一天的商业指导。但我不想通过帮助他人来收费，我想免费传授你们知识。今天我将给予你们创业、发展企业、维持经营和出售企业所需的一切。但如果你连5分钟都无法坚持观看就关闭视频，那我必须告诉你：你很可能不会成功。接下来我将列出未来45分钟要讲解的所有内容：改变你的思维模式，提供成功所需的工具，并希望能在你大脑中开辟新的路径，为你创造成功的机会。教育体系最不愿让你成为的，正是自由的状态：为自己工作，掌控自己的命运。

Today we will cover how to start a business with no money, how to win and the secret to it all in business, how to lose (which is important), how to create a mind map (which is much better than a business plan and more flexible), how to find purpose (very important for motivating yourself and your team to get up in the morning, and for motivating customers to work with you), how to find a co-founder (something I personally believe is like a relationship partnership – it can change everything if you have the right co-founder and provide the accountability we all need), how to sell (everyone can sell; there's no such thing as people who are naturally good or bad at selling – it's just that some haven't been taught the system; everyone can and must learn to sell, as it is the key to unlocking freedom), how to market your business, how to handle PR for yourself and your business, how to get an investor (I will discuss various approaches on this topic), and how to get sponsors (often an untapped secret source).

今天我们将讨论如何零资金创业，如何在商业中获胜及其秘诀，如何面对失败（这很重要），如何制作思维导图（比商业计划更优且更灵活），如何找到目标（这对激励自己和团队早起、以及吸引客户合作非常重要），如何寻找联合创始人（我个人认为这如同建立伴侣关系——找到合适的联合创始人可以改变一切，并提供我们所需的问责机制），如何销售（每个人都能销售；不存在天生擅长或不擅长销售的人——只是有些人尚未学会销售体系；每个人都能且必须学会销售，因为这是实现自由的关键），如何营销你的业务，如何为自己和业务进行公关，如何获得投资者（我将探讨这方面的多种方法），以及如何获得赞助商（这常是一个未被发掘的秘密资源）。

To make a business grow without needing an investor, we'll get into how to build a company brand. I honestly think value comes from building a brand, not a business. We'll go into what a brand is and how to build one. We'll discuss how to build a personal brand, which in this day and age is vital. You can't really build a company today without having a personal brand. I'll get into personal brand on a public stage and personal brand within your industry. We'll cover how to hire, how to grow, how to build, and how to go global, which is easier than it sounds and very important so you're not stuck in one market and leaving yourself vulnerable. We'll discuss how to get a mentor, as there is a way to do it and nearly nobody does it. We'll cover how to avoid big mistakes but accept luck into your life and make luck happen. Finally, we'll discuss how equity works and how to sell your business. At the end of this video, you will know everything that's taken me 35 years to know. You will be changed if you watch this video.

无需投资者即可实现业务增长，我们将深入探讨如何建立公司品牌。我真诚认为价值来源于打造品牌而非单纯经营企业。我们将解析品牌定义及构建方法。探讨个人品牌建设，这在当今时代至关重要。如今没有个人品牌几乎不可能成功创办企业。我将阐述公共舞台上的个人品牌及行业内的个人品牌建设。我们将涵盖招聘策略、发展方法、构建体系以及全球化拓展——这比听上去更简单且至关重要，避免困于单一市场而陷入被动。探讨寻找导师的方法，虽然存在有效途径却鲜有人实践。学习如何规避重大错误同时接纳运气因素，让幸运降临。最后解析股权运作机制与企业出售策略。观看本视频后，您将掌握我耗费35年积累的全部知识。若您认真观看，人生必将发生改变。

I promise you, at the end of it, it will cost you nothing and you'll never regret it. How to start now? Most people tell you to start a business when you have an idea. That's not where a business starts. A business starts with a feeling, an instinct that perhaps you need to make a change, and then applying yourself to learning what is the best way to build something that you love. Now everybody tells me that starting a business is filling a market gap or finding a niche. That is not true. One of my most successful early companies was a company called Fluid. This company turned into one of the biggest agencies in Asia, which I sold to PricewaterhouseCoopers for more money than I ever need. And when I launched that company, there were 500 other businesses doing almost exactly the same. So how did I manage to win? I didn't have an original idea like everybody tells you you've got to have to start a business. You don't start with an original idea. You start with what you like doing. Now I love helping businesses and people succeed. I love marketing. I can spend all day long studying.

我向你保证，最终它不会花费你任何东西，你也绝不会后悔。现在如何开始？大多数人告诉你，当你有一个想法时就可以创业。但创业并非始于想法。创业始于一种感觉，一种本能——也许你需要做出改变，然后致力于学习如何以最佳方式构建你所热爱的事物。现在每个人都告诉我创业就是填补市场空白或找到利基市场。这并不正确。我早期最成功的公司之一是一家名为Fluid的公司。这家公司后来发展成为亚洲最大的代理商之一，我将其出售给普华永道，获得了远超我所需的资金。当我创立那家公司时，还有500家其他企业几乎在做完全相同的事情。那么我是如何取胜的？我并没有像大家所说的那样拥有原创想法来创业。你不需要从原创想法开始。你要从自己喜欢做的事情开始。我喜欢帮助企业与人成功。我热爱市场营销。我可以整天研究学习。

I can spend all day long studying and understanding marketing. Every time someone launches a new business, I want to understand how they made it successful. I'm obsessed. I enjoy it. It's my hobby. There is no work life balance. There is only syncing up your life with your business. I believe the first step in starting a business is following your passions. Now everybody tells you that's not the way to start a business because often your passions initially don't necessarily generate revenue. But that's because you haven't applied a business mindset to what you love. I loved marketing and I started a creative agency called Fluid that helped people come up with marketing ideas to make their business successful. Now there were many companies doing it, but not many of these people doing it loved it like I did. So I evolved my marketing abilities, pushed the boundaries of what was possible, used new technologies like at the time email marketing and direct marketing that no one else was doing because I was obsessed with what is the latest thing.

我可以整天研究和理解市场营销。每当有人创办新企业时，我都想了解他们是如何取得成功的。我对此着迷。我很享受这个过程。这是我的爱好。不存在工作与生活的平衡。只有将你的生活与事业同步。我相信创业的第一步是追随你的热情。现在每个人都告诉你这不是创业的正确方式，因为通常你的热情最初并不一定能产生收入。但那是因为你还没有将商业思维应用到你热爱的事物上。我热爱市场营销，于是创办了一家名为Fluid的创意机构，帮助人们提出营销创意以使他们的业务成功。当时有很多公司都在做这个，但从事这项工作的人中很少有人像我这样热爱它。所以我不断提升自己的营销能力，突破可能的界限，使用当时的新技术，比如电子邮件营销和直复营销，这些当时没有其他人做的领域，因为我痴迷于最新的事物。

You have to write down what you like doing and what you don't like doing. What you love doing, you've got to get really good at. What you don't like doing, you've got to outsource and not do it. The school system has taught you the wrong thing: that if you're not good at something, you need to spend more time getting better at it. That is a lie. You've got to spend more time getting good at the thing you love to do. Get obsessed by it, and that's actually where a business idea begins. Because once you have figured out what you like doing, the next step is the idea. Now again, people will tell you that you need to come up with an original idea. That's not true. The second thing is when it comes to an idea, you can actually combine forces with other people. So back to my example: when I launched Fluid, I loved marketing and I met someone who could take my marketing ideas and turn them into graphic illustrations and brilliant presentations and abilities to help that company in a visual way understand my ideas. So I teamed up with her and created a 50/50 business partner.

你必须写下你喜欢做什么和不喜欢做什么。你热爱的事情，必须真正精通。你不喜欢的事情，必须外包出去不再亲自处理。学校教育给你灌输了错误观念：如果你不擅长某件事，就需要花更多时间来提高。这是个谎言。你应该把更多时间花在精通自己热爱的事情上。对此着迷，这实际上就是商业创意的起点。因为一旦你弄清楚自己喜欢做什么，下一步就是创意。人们会告诉你需要想出原创的点子，这并不正确。第二点是关于创意，你实际上可以与他人合作。回到我的例子：当我创立Fluid时，我热爱市场营销，我遇到了一位能将我的营销想法转化为图形插画和精彩演示的人，她具备通过视觉方式帮助公司理解我想法的能力。于是我与她合作，建立了五五平分的商业伙伴关系。

I'll come on to equity later in the video. That was literally the springboard to one of the most successful companies in Asia in this space. So the key is not coming up with an original idea and trying to do it all on your own. The key is coming up with something you love linked to what you do. And perhaps if there's a gap within your ability to execute on what you love, find a partner. For example, if you love writing then write a book, and maybe you need to find a partner that can publish that book or find a company that will publish that book or get someone to help you like an agent find someone that will publish that book. And that's where it really begins in the idea phase. It's got to link to your passion, and I'll come on to purpose later, but it's key. You won't be able to follow through and probably won't be successful if you're not willing to do the thing that you're doing more often and all the time compared to other people. So you figured out what you love doing and now you have an idea.

我将在视频后面谈到股权问题。那确实是亚洲这个领域最成功的公司之一的跳板。关键不是提出一个原创想法并试图独自完成所有事情。关键是要找到与你所做工作相关的、你热爱的事情。如果你在执行热爱之事的能力上存在差距，也许可以找一个合作伙伴。例如，如果你热爱写作，那就写一本书，也许你需要找到一个能出版这本书的合作伙伴，或者找一家愿意出版这本书的公司，或者找一个像经纪人这样的人帮你找到愿意出版这本书的人。这就是在创意阶段真正开始的地方。它必须与你的热情相关联，我稍后会谈到目标，但这很关键。如果你不愿意比别人更频繁、更持续地做你正在做的事情，你将无法坚持下去，很可能也不会成功。所以你已经弄清楚了自己喜欢做什么，现在你有了一个想法。

From my point of view, when I started what I'm doing today, which is a platform to help you for free, the first thing I did was in fact a podcast. So the step after idea is step one execution, and execution involves what is the first thing you can do to make your business idea come to life. For me in my example, it was a podcast, but for you it might be a blog, it might be a LinkedIn post, it might be setting up a social media handle and starting to post up your photography. Whatever the first step execution is, do not make it too hard for yourself. In my case, sitting down interviewing people I found interesting, recording it and putting it up would serve the purpose of giving people mentorship in a podcast for free, which was my first step in my mission in my recent business. So all I really did was get a microphone, sit down and record conversations. Now if you go back and look at those very early podcasts, execution was not brilliant, the guests were good, the execution was not great.

从我的角度来看，当我开始现在所做的事情——即创建一个免费帮助你的平台时，我实际做的第一件事就是播客。因此，想法之后的步骤是第一步执行，执行涉及的是你能做什么来让商业想法变为现实。以我为例是播客，但对你来说可能是博客，可能是领英帖子，可能是创建社交媒体账号并开始发布你的摄影作品。无论第一步执行是什么，都不要把它搞得太复杂。就我而言，坐下来采访我觉得有趣的人，录制并发布，就能实现通过播客免费为人们提供指导的目的，这是我近期商业使命中的第一步。所以我真正做的就是拿个麦克风，坐下来录制对话。如果你回头去看那些早期播客，执行并不出色，嘉宾很棒，但执行并不理想。

I had a rubbish microphone and a rubbish camera, and I slowly improved. Step one is to come up with a simple execution plan. Step two in starting a business is to consider where the revenue is going to come from. Some people say you need this within the idea phase, and yes, you can put it within the idea phase, but sometimes revenue doesn't actually make itself clear until you start. For example, if you're a photographer and you think you're going to make your money charging by the hour for your photography skills, you're probably limiting yourself. You're probably better off initially taking pictures of things you love, putting them up online, and seeing if people would buy them or license the pictures. Experiment with revenue models and see what sticks. Sure, maybe people will book you by the hour, but why would you start off with a revenue model that limits yourself? So I think when building a business, the thing to really think about is not necessarily revenue but experimenting with different ways to make money from the thing that you are doing. Again, when I launched Fluid most companies.

我当初用的是劣质麦克风和劣质摄像头，后来慢慢改进。第一步是制定一个简单的执行计划。创业的第二步是考虑收入来源。有些人说在构思阶段就需要考虑这一点，确实可以放在构思阶段，但有时直到开始行动后收入模式才会变得清晰。例如，如果你是摄影师，认为自己可以通过按小时收费来赚钱，那可能是在自我设限。更好的做法是，先拍摄你喜爱的事物，上传到网上，看看是否有人愿意购买或授权使用这些照片。尝试不同的收入模式，看看哪种可行。当然，可能会有人按小时预约你，但为什么要从一开始就选择限制自己的收入模式呢？因此我认为，创业时真正需要考虑的不一定是收入本身，而是如何通过你正在做的事情尝试不同的盈利方式。再比如，当我推出Fluid时，大多数公司...

Most companies charge by the hour for their marketing consultancy service. We didn't. We charged by the outcome of what we did. So if we helped a company be successful and sell more product, we took a percentage of those sales. Now that was not part of most companies' business models because most people start with an idea, then they do a revenue model, and then they start. A famous quote is: "Everyone's got a plan till they get punched in their face." The truth is when you launch a business, you just want to keep yourself nimble like a boxer. You want to see what is going to be the best punch combination for you to make your business work. Finally, when starting a business, step three is you've got to make sure your purpose is strong. Now you've made sure that you enjoy what you do, and that's great because that's going to help you get up in the morning. But actually, I believe new businesses today need to think about what they're going to do to make a difference in the world.

大多数公司按小时收取营销咨询服务费，我们则不然。我们根据工作成果收费。如果我们帮助一家公司取得成功并销售更多产品，我们会从中抽取一定比例的分成。这种做法并不符合大多数公司的商业模式，因为多数人先有创意，再制定收入模式，然后开始创业。有句名言说得好："每个人在挨揍前都信心满满。"事实上，当你创办企业时，你需要像拳击手那样保持灵活应变。你需要找到最适合让企业运转的"组合拳法"。最后，创业的第三步是确保你拥有坚定的使命。既然你已经确保自己热爱所做之事，这很好，因为这会激励你每日早起奋斗。但实际上，我认为当今的新企业需要思考如何为世界创造积极影响。

How are you going to make sure that people want to work with you? How are you going to make sure that what you're doing isn't just for profit? Because if it's just for profit, everybody that works for you is going to want more money, and everybody that's working with you is going to want to pay you less. But if you have a purpose bigger than yourself and identify that purpose and install it in your business, I promise you, you won't be managing people anymore. One of the biggest stresses of building a company, you won't have to manage people because you only have to manage purpose. Now I'm going to go into more depth how this all works, but a lot of what I've talked about here already has cost you no money. You haven't had to spend any money. Now even if your idea is to launch an app that costs a million pounds to develop, start off with a service business. Start off with a revenue based model that can get you there. An example is Airbnb when they launched. They actually sold serial boxes at conventions. It was enough to be similar to Airbnb because some were the first accommodation Airbnb ever sold.

你如何确保人们愿意与你共事？你如何确保你所做的不只是为了利润？因为如果仅仅为了利润，每个为你工作的人都会想要更多钱，而每个与你合作的人都想少付你钱。但如果你有一个超越自我的目标，明确这个目标并将其植入你的业务中，我向你保证，你将不再需要管理人。创办公司最大的压力之一就是管理员工，而你只需管理目标即可。接下来我将更深入地探讨这一切如何运作，但到目前为止我所谈的很多内容都不需要你花费任何金钱。你根本不需要花钱。即使你的想法是开发一个耗资百万英镑的应用程序，也要从服务业务开始。从能够带你实现目标的收入模式开始。以爱彼迎为例，他们刚起步时实际上是在展会上卖麦片盒。这已经足够类似爱彼迎的业务模式，因为其中一些就是爱彼迎最早提供的住宿服务。

At conventions, people go to see Obama speak and go to see different politicians speak at these conventions. Initially, they sold serial boxes. Obama reels at these events to get to know their customers, connect to their customers, have a conversation with their customers, and make money. That is the money they use to initially get the business going. I will come on to other steps later in the video about raising money and other ways to do this. But if you do these first few things, your business is up and running. It costs you no money, and I promise you because it will have purpose, because you like it, and because there's a revenue model behind it, you will do it. It will happen.

在大会上，人们去看奥巴马演讲，去看不同的政客在这些大会上发言。最初，他们出售系列产品。奥巴马在这些活动中与客户互动，了解客户、联系客户、与客户对话并赚钱。这就是他们最初用来启动业务的资金。我稍后会在视频中讨论其他步骤，关于筹集资金和其他方法。但如果你完成了这些初步工作，你的业务就已经启动并运行。它不需要你花费任何资金，我向你保证，因为它有目标，因为你喜欢它，并且因为它背后有收入模式，你会去做。它会实现。

How to win in business? Let's say you've already got a company, you're not winning and you want to win, or you want to know the secret formula to winning. Having built nearly 19 companies, I'm on my 19th business now. How to win in business is actually very simple. I mentioned earlier having purpose and you personally being passionate about it. That's definitely going to give you an edge because most people are not loving what they're doing, so if you are, you're already winning. But there is a secret formula to winning, and that starts with a couple of things. Number one: delayed gratification. Spelled completely wrong, but you get what I mean though, right? Delayed gratification is the number one reason that businesses win. You don't rush to charge customers, for example. You let them help you succeed. The first customer I ever got in my agency Fluid, I actually did the work for free. Now a lot of people say don't do the work for free, I don't agree. I built up a relationship with that customer, overdelivered when it was free, and that meant once they were happy, not only did they use me forever for the 16 years that I ran that company, they also recommended me to everybody. They felt like they were part of my early journey. Getting your customers on side is another element of winning. But realizing that if you delay getting gratification, you will make more money. There are so many examples of this if you look at big businesses.

如何在商业中获胜？假设你已经拥有一家公司，但尚未取得成功，你想要获胜，或者你想知道获胜的秘诀。我已经创立了近19家公司，现在正在经营第19家企业。在商业中获胜其实非常简单。我之前提到过要有目标，并且你个人要对此充满热情。这绝对会给你带来优势，因为大多数人并不热爱他们正在做的事情，所以如果你热爱，你就已经赢了。但获胜有一个秘密公式，这要从几个方面开始。第一：延迟满足。虽然拼写完全错误，但你明白我的意思，对吧？延迟满足是企业获胜的首要原因。例如，不要急于向客户收费。你让他们帮助你成功。我在我的代理公司Fluid获得的第一个客户，我实际上是免费为他们工作的。现在很多人说不要免费工作，我不同意。我与那位客户建立了关系，在免费时超额交付，这意味着一旦他们满意，不仅在我经营那家公司的16年里一直使用我的服务，还向所有人推荐我。他们感觉自己是我早期旅程的一部分。让客户站在你这边是获胜的另一个要素。但要认识到，如果你延迟获得满足，你会赚更多钱。如果你看看大企业，这样的例子比比皆是。

They spent years making no money, and then when they had the system all in place, huge databases for example, they can monetize. People don't wait long enough. The other thing you can do is have a very strict moral code within your business culture. Culture will eat strategy for breakfast every single time. You've got to make sure that your culture in the company is client-centric. A good example of this is Amazon. I'm just saying that they do actually focus on their customers as a culture. I think that a lot of people are too busy, for example, thinking about how they can get money out of their customer and not thinking how they can bring value. If you want to win, bring value. You want loyalty, bring value. You want them to follow you, promote you, share you on their stories, care about you, talk about you when you're not in the room, then show them some love. It sounds simple, but people don't do it because they're too busy not waiting for the payoff and too busy not installing a culture of patience, a culture of caring about your

他们多年不赚钱，当整个系统就位后，比如建立了庞大的数据库，他们就能实现盈利。人们往往缺乏足够的耐心。另一件你可以做的事是在企业文化建设中制定严格的道德准则。文化永远比战略更重要。你必须确保公司的文化以客户为中心。亚马逊就是一个很好的例子。我只是说他们确实将关注客户作为企业文化。我认为很多人过于忙碌，比如只想着如何从客户那里赚钱，而不思考如何创造价值。如果你想获胜，就要创造价值。你想要忠诚，就要创造价值。你希望他们追随你、推广你、在他们的社交动态中分享你、关心你、在你不在场时讨论你，那么就要给予他们关爱。这听起来很简单，但人们做不到，因为他们过于急功近利，未能建立耐心文化，未能建立关爱你的

A culture of caring about your customer. And then the final thing is luck. Now luck is not a subjective thing. Luck, I have discovered, is hackable, and you can hack luck three ways. First, be persistent. What I mentioned earlier about purpose and loving what you do will help you be persistent. You have to outlast other people. When I launched my company Fluid in Hong Kong, I had so many competitors, but slowly but surely they all shut down, went bankrupt. They didn't care like I did, and I think that whole luck thing is about persistence. That's number one. Number two in hacking luck is know your destination. What is success for you? What will make you happy? What do you want? Big company, small company? And by the way, a big company is much easier to run than a small company. Aim for a big company is my recommendation, but that's my opinion. It might not work for you, so I suggest you to find success for yourself. Today, success for me is having the time to take my son to school and be able to pick him up, is having time to do the exercise I want to do.

重视客户关怀的文化。最后一点是运气。运气并非主观事物。我发现运气是可以被操控的，你可以通过三种方式操控运气。第一，保持坚持。我之前提到的关于目标和热爱你所做的事情会帮助你保持坚持。你必须比其他人坚持得更久。当我在香港创办我的公司Fluid时，我有很多竞争对手，但慢慢地他们都关闭了，破产了。他们不像我那样在乎，我认为运气的关键在于坚持。这是第一点。操控运气的第二点是明确你的目标。对你来说什么是成功？什么会让你快乐？你想要什么？大公司还是小公司？顺便说一下，大公司比小公司更容易经营。我的建议是瞄准大公司，但这只是我的观点。可能不适合你，所以我建议你找到属于自己的成功。今天，对我来说，成功就是有时间送儿子上学并接他回家，就是有时间做我想做的运动。

is having time to do the exercise I want to do that's how I define success so I never sell hours and we'll come to that in a little little bit why you should never sell hours but luck is hackable you have to be persistent you have to know your destination and finally you have to learn to take risk be careful with sayings out there trying to trick you into options that are not true so the worst one is the harder you work the luckier you get that is not true that is a lie a lie designed to make you work hard if it was true every nurse in this country would be a millionaire it is not true that working hard equals success what equals success is taking risk you have to learn to take risk lean into fear learn to love fear embrace it and then you can take more risk and the more risk you take the luckier you get learn to build culture into your businesses about the long term and learn to hack luck you will win the secret to it all is learning to accept that you could lose everything and it doesn't matter you've got to be willing to risk

能够有时间做我想做的锻炼，这就是我对成功的定义，所以我从不按小时出售时间，稍后我们会详细讨论为什么你永远不应该按小时收费。但运气是可以被操控的，你必须坚持不懈，你必须知道自己的目标，最后你必须学会承担风险。要小心那些试图欺骗你选择不真实选项的说法，最糟糕的就是"你越努力，运气就越好"，这不是真的，这是个谎言，一个旨在让你努力工作的谎言。如果这是真的，这个国家的每个护士都会成为百万富翁。努力工作不等于成功，成功的关键在于承担风险。你必须学会承担风险，直面恐惧，学会热爱恐惧，拥抱它，然后你就能承担更多风险。你承担的风险越多，运气就越好。学会在业务中建立长期文化，学会操控运气，你就会获胜。这一切的秘诀在于学会接受你可能会失去一切，但这并不重要，你必须愿意冒险。

You've got to be willing to risk it all, take a chance and go for it. Do not rush, do not see this as anything but a marathon. It's not a sprint, enjoy the journey. No one can beat you if you do it, so delay gratification is key. Brands like Facebook and Instagram, although I'm not necessarily a fan of these platforms, they personify this concept. They built massive user bases but didn't monetize them at the beginning. They waited and kept building value in their platforms for the users. More people kept signing up and they didn't actually monetize for a very long time. I think Facebook was near 10 years before it started making money. Although I'm not suggesting you wait 10 years, and those companies have different investment structures which we'll talk about a bit later, it is important to understand how important this is to building a successful long-term business. Do not think about making money straight up, build a brand not a business. Those businesses like Facebook and Instagram waited a decade before they started monetizing, and as soon as they started monetizing, Facebook in particular started to decline.

你必须愿意承担全部风险，抓住机会放手一搏。不要急于求成，要把这视为一场马拉松而非短跑。享受这段旅程，从容不迫。如果你能做到这一点，就无人能敌，因此延迟满足是关键。像Facebook和Instagram这样的品牌，虽然我不一定是这些平台的粉丝，但它们完美诠释了这一理念。它们建立了庞大的用户群，但最初并未进行商业化。它们耐心等待，持续为用户构建平台价值。越来越多的人不断加入，而它们在很长一段时间内都没有实际盈利。我记得Facebook差不多等了10年才开始赚钱。虽然我不是建议你也等待10年，而且这些公司有着不同的投资结构（我们稍后会讨论），但理解这一点对建立成功的长期企业至关重要。不要一开始就想着赚钱，要打造品牌而非生意。像Facebook和Instagram这样的企业等待了十年才开始商业化，而一旦开始盈利，特别是Facebook，就开始走下坡路了。

As a brand, less people liked it. Too many ads on the screen, too many annoying buttons that didn't have any relevance to them because they were suddenly trying to make their client happy, the advertiser, and no longer focused on the user in the same way. So be careful, but that is how you build massive economic models. People like Google, similar at the beginning, no revenue. YouTube at the beginning, no revenue. Focus on building something that has value for people. Delayed gratification is one of the secret weapons in building a sustainable, large and successful business that you love.

作为一个品牌，喜欢它的人变少了。屏幕上广告太多，烦人的按钮太多，这些按钮与用户毫无关联，因为他们突然试图让客户——广告商满意，而不再以同样的方式关注用户。所以要小心，但这就是你建立庞大经济模式的方式。像谷歌这样的公司，起初也类似，没有收入。YouTube起初也没有收入。专注于打造对人们有价值的东西。延迟满足是建立一个你热爱的可持续、大规模且成功的企业秘诀之一。

I guarantee you if I hadn't lost a million pounds on the doomed comic book business, I wouldn't be rich or successful today. I needed to learn how to fail. I needed to accept losing. It's key. So how do you build the stamina and the ability to lose? The first thing you realize, number one, don't let things own you. If you let things own you, you are controlled by the very thing that's meant to bring you pleasure. You have to learn to lose those things and not care about those things. The second thing to lose, you need to let your short-term ego go. Now ego is actually a very powerful motivator, and there are different types of ego. The ego I'm talking about here is driving around in the right car to give an image to people that don't care about you that you are successful. Do not worry about this. Learn to enjoy looking like you're a loser. Let people underestimate you. It is so powerful to be underestimated by your competition, even by your customers, because if they think you can't deliver and you do, then brilliant. Do not worry about losing. Learn to be a D student. Love to fail.

我向你保证，如果不是因为在注定失败的漫画书生意上损失了一百万英镑，我今天就不会富有或成功。我需要学会如何失败。我需要接受失去。这很关键。那么如何培养承受损失的能力和耐力呢？你首先要意识到，第一，不要让事物掌控你。如果你让事物掌控你，你就会被本应带给你快乐的东西所控制。你必须学会失去那些东西，并且不在乎它们。第二件需要失去的东西，你需要放下短期的自我。实际上，自我是一种非常强大的动力，而且有不同类型的自我。我这里所说的自我是指开着合适的车到处转悠，向那些不在乎你的人展示你成功的形象。不要担心这个。学会享受看起来像个失败者的感觉。让人们低估你。被竞争对手甚至客户低估是非常强大的，因为如果他们认为你无法交付，而你做到了，那就太棒了。不要担心失败。学会做个差等生。热爱失败。

That's why 80% of A students end up working for D students, because A students are scared to lose. They don't want to lose, they always want to get an A, they always want to be seen as the smartest person in the room. Don't worry about it, learn to lose, learn to embrace getting a D. Getting a D in business means take your time, don't let someone else decide whether or not you're successful. Do not let anybody else tell you how to do things. Ironically, power up your ego in a different way - an internal ego that tells you you're not a loser. You know where you're going no matter what people judge you based on the car that you're driving or where you're living or what you do with your day. Don't let them decide that you're a loser, let them think whatever they want. Learn to love losing, learn to embrace failure. I promise you, if you think that the worst is if you try something and you lose everything, it doesn't matter - you can go again, you will succeed, I guarantee it.

这就是为什么80%的优等生最终为差等生工作，因为优等生害怕失败。他们不想输，他们总是想得A，他们总是想成为房间里最聪明的人。别担心这个，学会失败，学会接受得D。在商业中得D意味着慢慢来，不要让别人决定你是否成功。不要让任何人告诉你该怎么做。讽刺的是，用不同的方式增强你的自尊心——一种内在的自尊告诉你你不是失败者。无论人们根据你开的车、住的地方或日常行为如何评判你，你都清楚自己的方向。不要让他们认定你是失败者，让他们随心所欲地去想。学会热爱失败，学会拥抱失败。我向你保证，如果你认为最坏的情况是尝试某事并失去一切，那没关系——你可以重新开始，你会成功的，我保证。

Next up, I want to teach you something practical: how to do a mind map. So many people teach you in business to do a business plan. Forget that. There is no use for a business plan. What you want to do is map out where your business could go, how it could go, and understand the different directions in which to take your business. I'm going to go through how to do a mind map next. Now, I have never seen anyone teach anybody how to do a mind map. The reason I think that no one teaches this is because there's no template to sell you. There's no product to sell you around. A business plan has a million ways to make money out of you, and none of it works. These business plan things actually kill companies. I've seen people who have massive business plans stick to it and die. A mind map, however, will cost you nothing to do and actually leaves you nimble and free to explore where the business can go. It's so simple. It starts in the middle with your hobby, whatever that is, what you love to do. The second part of a mind map is the business.

接下来，我要教你一些实用的东西：如何制作思维导图。很多人在商业领域教你制定商业计划书。忘了它吧。商业计划书毫无用处。你需要做的是规划出你的业务可能的发展方向、发展方式，并理解可以带领业务前进的不同路径。接下来我将详细介绍如何制作思维导图。我从未见过有人教别人如何制作思维导图。我认为没有人教授这个技能的原因是因为没有模板可以卖给你，也没有相关的产品可以销售。而商业计划书则有无数种方法从你身上赚钱，但这些方法都行不通。这些商业计划书实际上会扼杀公司。我见过有些人制定了庞大的商业计划并坚持执行，最终走向失败。然而，思维导图不需要任何成本，实际上能让你保持灵活，自由探索业务可能的发展方向。它非常简单，从中间开始，以你的爱好为中心，无论那是什么，只要是你热爱做的事情。思维导图的第二部分是业务。

I can't spell, but don't judge me for that. Luckily, I know I'm doing a business. What is the business? So what is your hobby? What do you love to do? And ideally, it now links to the business. Now with the business, I'm going to use my company as an example. Hopefully, it translates into what maybe your idea is. But in my business, which is what we call Free Humanity, the name probably gives it away what we want to do. We want people to be free to do what they love. So within Free Humanity, this is what I did when I first started the business four years ago. I looked at different ways that I can make the business work. So off here, I wrote podcast. Right, actually, as I mentioned earlier, this is one of the first things I actually did. So from a podcast, what comes off it? Well, I build a network. Right, I'm now doing a mind map of something I actually have already done to illustrate how mind map works when you're building out a business of value. So one of the benefits of doing a podcast was a network. In my case, I managed

我拼写不好，但请不要因此评判我。幸运的是，我知道自己在经营事业。这是什么事业呢？你的爱好是什么？你喜欢做什么？理想情况下，它现在应该与事业联系起来。现在以我的事业为例，希望能启发你的想法。我的事业叫做"自由人类"，这个名字可能已经表明了我们的目标——我们希望人们能自由地做自己热爱的事。在自由人类这个事业中，这是我四年前创业时所做的：我研究了各种让事业运作的方法。在这里我写了"播客"，正如我之前提到的，这实际上是我最早着手的事情之一。那么通过播客能带来什么？我建立了人脉网络。现在我正在用已经完成的事情绘制思维导图，来说明在构建有价值的事业时思维导图如何发挥作用。做播客的好处之一就是建立人脉网络，就我而言，我成功

In my case, I managed to interview over 200 of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, who are now part of my life and help me with what I'm doing. With Mind Maps, there's no stopping how big a mind map can get, just like your brain is infinite in its ability to think. Mind maps are also infinite. When I wrote the original mind map out for my business, I thought about brands and started listing them. In my case, GoDaddy, Tide Banking, Adobe - these were brands that I felt were a fit with what I wanted to do: give people the ability to start their own business, be free, and do what they love. So I listed out all the brands that I could work with.

就我而言，我成功采访了200多位世界顶级企业家，他们现在已成为我生活的一部分，并在我所做的事业中给予我帮助。思维导图的发展潜力是无限的，就像你的大脑拥有无限的思考能力一样。思维导图同样没有边界。当我为我的业务绘制最初的思维导图时，我考虑了品牌并开始列出它们。以我为例，GoDaddy、Tide Banking、Adobe——这些品牌与我想要实现的目标相契合：赋予人们自主创业的能力，获得自由，做自己热爱的事情。因此我列出了所有可能合作的品牌。

In my original mind map, I also listed an app that would focus on providing free help for people. At the time, I didn't have the name I now have, which is helpbank.com, but I knew I needed to build a scalable way of giving people knowledge. What I didn't know back then, but I know now, is that the word "app" is overused. For most platforms, you don't actually need to build an app at the beginning; you need to build a web-based platform. Why? If you build an app, you have to go through the App Store or Google Play Store, which restricts you to one of those two locations. For example, people with Samsung phones can't access the Apple Store to download your app. Why would you restrict people from accessing your product when you launch something? Plus, if it's web-based, people can log in directly from any web browser. That aside, I realized in my early days that I needed to create an app, and from that, I would provide free help, and from that, I would

在我最初的思维导图中，我还列出了一个专注于为人们提供免费帮助的应用程序。当时我还没有现在这个名字——helpbank.com，但我知道我需要构建一个可扩展的知识分享方式。我当时不知道但现在明白的是，"应用程序"这个词被过度使用了。对于大多数平台来说，你实际上不需要一开始就构建应用程序，而是需要构建一个基于网络的平台。为什么？如果你构建应用程序，就必须通过App Store或Google Play Store上架，这会将你限制在这两个平台之一。例如，使用三星手机的人无法通过Apple Store下载你的应用程序。当你推出某个产品时，为什么要限制人们获取它的渠道呢？此外，如果是基于网络的平台，人们可以直接通过任何网页浏览器登录。尽管如此，我在早期意识到我需要创建一个应用程序，通过它提供免费帮助，并由此

I would be able to connect the network that I built in the podcast to the free help for the people that I had interviewed. In the podcast, I was capturing the knowledge from their cases. I could connect the network being built via the podcast to the help on the platform. This is how it actually played out. The next thing I spent time thinking about was team. On my map, I thought about who I actually needed. Because I knew I was going to do a podcast, I knew that I needed an editor. But I also know my weaknesses, so I know I need an accountant, someone that's going to take care of the admin. These are things that I don't enjoy doing. I know what to do, but I also realized with the network that I built through the podcast that I could have partners. So it's not just employees but partners. I could link to the team again, working with the people that I'd spoken to on the podcast. I could connect them to people that were going to work on the app.

我能够将我在播客中建立的网络与为受访者提供的免费帮助连接起来。在播客中，我从他们的案例中获取知识。我可以将通过播客建立的网络与平台上的帮助连接起来。实际情况就是这样发展的。接下来我花时间思考的是团队问题。在我的规划中，我思考了实际需要哪些人。因为我知道我要做播客，所以我知道需要一名编辑。但我也清楚自己的弱点，因此我知道需要一名会计，有人来处理行政事务。这些都是我不喜欢做的事情。我知道该做什么，但我也意识到通过播客建立的网络可以让我拥有合作伙伴。所以不仅仅是员工，还有合作伙伴。我可以再次与团队建立联系，与我在播客中交谈过的人合作。我可以把他们和将要开发应用程序的人联系起来。

I could connect them, although they're not necessarily on my payroll. They are people that perhaps are connected to my mission, want to help people, and they can become part of my extended team. Now within the team structure, I can also start thinking about things like if I have an editor, maybe that editor hires editors or I hire editors. But you can start breaking down what you actually need within your team right now as a mind map. You start, in my opinion, with what your hobbies are, what you enjoy doing. You're then building a business around it, and then you're thinking about different things that this business is going to need. Now one of the things that I spent a lot of time thinking about that I haven't yet done but will be coming soon in my platform was what else I could do that would scale the business, give it what it needed resource-wise without necessarily me being involved in it. And at that time back four years ago, the word was merchandising, so I wrote down merchandising. Now I think it's actually evolved now, it's beyond merchandising.

我可以联系他们，尽管他们不一定在我的工资单上。这些人可能和我的使命有关联，想要帮助他人，他们可以成为我扩展团队的一部分。在团队结构中，我也可以开始考虑一些事情，比如如果我有一个编辑，也许那个编辑会雇佣编辑，或者我雇佣编辑。但你可以现在就开始用思维导图分解你团队实际需要什么。在我看来，你应该从你的爱好开始，从你喜欢做的事情开始。然后围绕它建立业务，接着思考这个业务需要哪些不同的东西。有一件事我花了很多时间思考但尚未实施，即将在我的平台上推出的是，我还能做些什么来扩展业务，在资源方面满足其需求，而不一定需要我亲自参与。四年前那个时候，这个词是商品销售，所以我写下了商品销售。现在我认为它实际上已经发展演变，超越了商品销售的范畴。

But from that, I wrote down of course what everyone was doing four years ago: t-shirts and caps, that sort of stuff. Stuff that you know, maybe the word "Free Humanity" would look pretty cool on. And I thought about in those days things like sweets and products that perhaps we could launch. I wrote down basically any way merchandise-wise we could make money. Now what's interesting is I'm about to launch a sweet brand called "Bus's". It's taken four years to get to this part of my map, but it was on there. It was always on there. And ironically, when I was building team, if anyone said to me when I was interviewing them they had some experience with sweet business, I made a note and kept them as someone maybe could help us in the future. Same with merchandising. Anytime I spoke to anybody that was perhaps looking at starting a t-shirt brand or working on building product, I'd see if perhaps they wanted to work in the future. Because once you know in your mindmap one of the things that's going to come up in the future, you can look out as you're building other things for the very thing that's

但由此，我记下了四年前大家都在做的事情：T恤和帽子之类的商品。就是那些印上"自由人类"字样可能会很酷的东西。当时我还考虑了糖果和产品这类我们可能推出的东西。我基本上记下了所有能赚钱的周边商品方式。有趣的是，我即将推出一个名为"Bus's"的糖果品牌。我花了四年时间才走到思维导图的这个部分，但它一直都在那里。讽刺的是，当我组建团队时，如果在面试中有人提到他们有糖果行业的经验，我会记下来，把他们视为未来可能帮助我们的人。周边商品方面也是如此。每当我和那些可能想创立T恤品牌或开发产品的人交谈时，我都会留意他们是否愿意将来合作。因为一旦你知道思维导图中未来会出现某个事项，你在构建其他事物时就能留意那个特定的事物

because once you know in your mindmap one of the things that's going to come up in the future, you can look out as you're building other things for the very thing that's going to help make that happen. So this is a map that is literally mapping out all the different things and different ways that your business can go. It's fun, it's simple, there's no template you can download and pay someone for, you don't need it. And the beautiful thing about a mind map is you're not fixed, you can start adding bubbles and adding things as things evolve, as people and the world change. You can start adding things and connecting the different dots between parts of your business, something a 20-page document will never let you do because it's too linear. So that's a mind map, I hope it's a useful practical tool for you going forward.

因为当你在思维导图中预知未来可能出现的某个事项时，你就能在构建其他事物时留意那些有助于实现该目标的关键要素。这张思维导图实际上是在规划你业务可能发展的所有不同方向和途径。它既有趣又简单，无需下载模板或付费请人制作。思维导图的妙处在于它的灵活性——随着事物发展、人事变迁和世界变化，你可以随时添加分支和内容。你可以不断补充内容，将业务各个部分的不同节点连接起来，这是20页线性文档永远无法实现的功能。以上就是思维导图的介绍，希望它成为你未来实用的工具。

How to find purpose? Now this word purpose might sound woo, they don't teach you it at school in my opinion for a reason. Because if you understand purpose, you're very unlikely to work for someone else. Purpose is a very personal thing. You can find other people with purpose, you can find your tribe, you can be free. But finding purpose is not an easy thing and it's not something you've been given any of the tools in which to make happen. So what is the first step in finding purpose? And it's a very obvious step that people do not do. You think about it now. The problem is if you say you're thinking about purpose, people might laugh at you. Other people try to throw silly jokes out there like 49 and they'll throw you off. Or purpose will get so complicated in your head because you've not really thought about it before, you'll give up and go back to your old ways. You need to think about purpose. What is your purpose? We used to live in tribes of 5,000 and we used to work on a method called give without take, not give and take. We used to help each other because it would make our tribe better, not because we'd make money from it. You ask me for help, I will give it to you for free. The world will be a better place. I get better at giving you that help for free. I'd become an expert at giving that help for free. Eventually when I'm not in the room people will talk about me and what I do because I become

如何寻找人生目标？目标这个词听起来可能有些玄乎，学校不教这个我认为是有原因的。因为一旦你理解了目标的意义，就不太可能再为他人打工。目标是非常个人化的事情。你可以找到其他有目标的人，找到属于你的群体，获得自由。但寻找目标并非易事，你从未被赋予实现它所需的任何工具。那么寻找目标的第一步是什么？这是一个非常明显却很少有人去做的步骤：现在就开始思考。问题在于，如果你说正在思考人生目标，别人可能会嘲笑你。有人会试图抛出像49这样的愚蠢笑话来干扰你。或者因为之前从未真正思考过目标，它在你脑海中会变得过于复杂，导致你放弃并回归旧习。你必须思考目标：你的人生目标是什么？我们曾生活在5000人的部落中，遵循着"付出不索取"而非"等价交换"的原则。我们互相帮助是为了让部落更好，而不是为了赚钱。你向我求助，我会无偿提供帮助。世界会因此变得更美好。我在无偿帮助你的过程中不断精进，最终成为无偿提供这种帮助的专家。当我不在场时，人们会谈论我和我所做的事，因为我成为了

Because I became so good at helping people, but I think today that doesn't fit the narrative of working at a call center and picking up the phone and doing what you're told in a factory that Henry Ford created. So when the school system was developed, the word purpose wasn't included in any of it. They asked the wrong question of you: what are you going to do when you grow up is what schools say. That's not the right question. What you should be asked is: what problem are you going to solve? So the second step in thinking about and finding purpose is: what problem matters to you now? At first, nothing might spring to mind. If something has jumped into your mind then great. In a minute, I'm going to explain how you action that. But if it hasn't jumped into your mind, start thinking about what problems have actually affected you, big or small. Now it can be really simple, like the banks aren't open early enough for you, or the swimming pool you wanted to go to doesn't let you swim the time you want. It might sound silly, but you start thinking about problems that

因为我变得非常擅长帮助他人，但我觉得这在今天并不符合呼叫中心工作的叙事——只是接听电话，像亨利·福特创建的工厂里那样按指令行事。所以当教育体系建立时，"目标"这个词从未被包含其中。他们向你提出了错误的问题：学校总是问"你长大后要做什么"。这不是正确的问题。你应该被问的是：你要解决什么问题？因此，思考和寻找目标的第二步是：现在什么对你来说很重要的问题？起初可能什么都想不出来。如果有什么想法突然冒出来，那很好。稍后我会解释如何付诸行动。但如果还没有想法，就开始思考实际影响过你的问题，无论大小。这可能非常简单，比如银行开门时间不够早，或者你想去的游泳池不允许你在想要的时间游泳。这听起来可能很傻，但你要开始思考那些

It might sound silly, but you start thinking about problems that bother you, and your brain wakes up the entrepreneur muscle in your brain that helps you figure out how to solve that problem. Now it might be that the bank's not opening on time isn't a problem you're going to solve, but if your brain starts thinking about that problem and how it can solve it, you might begin to understand how to find purpose. The third thing you can do is start breaking down how to make your life and that purpose match. Now matching what you do in your day and your actual purpose is often easier than you think. I've met hundreds and hundreds of people who tell me what their dream is, and it turns out that their dream is often just 3% difference from their existing life. You know, between chimpanzees and humans, only 3% difference in the DNA. And often, for example, I met someone that wants to do their own catering business. They're working in someone else's catering business. They're just missing this video in their life to figure out how to turn what they feel is their purpose to make cakes for someone and make them smile and own that business.

这听起来可能有点傻，但当你开始思考困扰你的问题时，你的大脑会唤醒内在的企业家思维，帮助你找到解决问题的方法。也许银行不准时开门并不是你要解决的问题，但如果你开始思考这个问题及其解决方案，你可能会逐渐理解如何找到人生目标。你可以做的第三件事是开始分解如何让你的生活与这个目标相匹配。将日常活动与真实目标相匹配往往比你想象的要容易。我见过成百上千的人向我诉说他们的梦想，结果发现他们的梦想与现有生活往往只有3%的差异。要知道，黑猩猩和人类的DNA也只有3%的差异。比如我遇到过一位想自己经营餐饮业务的人，他当时在别人的餐饮企业工作。他们生活中缺少的正是这个视角，去理解如何将"为他人制作蛋糕、带来欢笑"这种使命感转化为属于自己的事业。

They're just missing this video in their life to figure out how to turn what they feel is their purpose to make cakes for someone and make them smile and own that business into that business. They're just missing knowledge. They're also not realizing that actually their purpose is nearly there. In fact, I would argue that the system sometimes wants you to feel like you're getting enough satisfaction that you don't need to make a change. So in other words, if you are working for someone else baking cakes, even if they're not using the ingredients you would use or they don't care about the customer the same way that you do, at least you are baking. But you've got to break free from this thinking. You've got to realize that if you're going to do your purpose, you have to learn what I said earlier: take risks but most importantly to truly know yourself. I once interviewed a billionaire on my podcast and I asked him how did you build your intuition. He said to me: I used to go and ask my mom or my dad a question when I was young, and they both used to say to me: you know the answer, you know it. They never gave him the answers, so he had to go away and figure out the answers for himself.

他们只是缺少这个视频来帮助他们理解如何将自认为的使命——为他人制作蛋糕并让他们微笑——转化为真正的事业。他们只是缺乏相关知识。他们也没有意识到，其实他们的使命几乎触手可及。事实上，我认为这个体系有时会让你感到满足，以至于你不需要做出改变。换句话说，即使你在为别人烘焙蛋糕，即使他们没有使用你想要的原料，或者不像你那样关心顾客，至少你还在烘焙。但你必须摆脱这种思维定式。你必须意识到，如果要实现自己的使命，就必须学习我早前说过的：承担风险，但最重要的是真正了解自己。我曾在我的播客节目中采访过一位亿万富翁，我问他如何培养直觉。他对我说：我小时候经常去问父母问题，他们总是对我说：你知道答案，你心里明白。他们从不直接给出答案，所以他必须自己去寻找答案。

And that in itself is the point I'm trying to make here. You have a purpose. Yes, I can help you get there, but you need to ask yourself what is that purpose. How are you going to make it happen? How are you going to get there? And you do it by thinking about it, asking yourself not what you're going to do when you grow up, but what problem you want to solve, and then matching your life to that problem. The final thing I'll say is you don't have to do this thing on your own. Let's say you care about climate change, and I would just say we don't need to save the planet, we need to save humans. When the humans are gone, the planet will be fine. But let's just say you care about saving the planet, you can go and work with other people doing something in this space. The only thing I would say to you is make sure you ask for equity wherever you work. I'll come to that a bit later, how you do that and why you should do that.

这本身就是我要表达的核心观点。你拥有一个目标。是的，我可以帮助你实现它，但你需要自问这个目标究竟是什么。你打算如何实现它？你准备如何抵达目标？方法是通过思考，不要问自己长大后要做什么，而要问自己想解决什么问题，然后将你的人生与那个问题相匹配。最后我想说的是，你无需独自完成这件事。假设你关注气候变化，我想说我们不需要拯救地球，我们需要拯救人类。当人类消失后，地球依然会很好。但假设你关心拯救地球，你可以与志同道合的人共同在这个领域贡献力量。我唯一要提醒你的是，无论在哪里工作，务必争取股权权益。稍后我会详细说明具体方法和理由。

But that can still be a way for you to have the life you want. You can find your purpose and then go work with someone that's actually doing it. In my organization behind the camera right now, there's a whole group of talented people that care about the same thing as me. They can go off and help people in their own way like they want to, or we can come together as a team and solve the problem together that people don't have the knowledge they need to do what they love. What I have noticed is that once you find your purpose, and this is what you need to be careful of, is that you don't think that it's such a big purpose like solving the world's problems that you don't do it. You can team up with other people to do it, and I will tell you 1 + 1 equals 11. Remember that once you know your purpose, you can seek out people and communities and old days tribes to help you go and fix this problem with other people. But if you don't know what that purpose is, you won't do this and you will get stuck working on someone else's purpose.

但这仍然可以成为你获得想要生活的一种方式。你可以找到自己的目标，然后与真正在做这件事的人合作。此刻在我镜头背后的团队里，有一群才华横溢的人，他们关心着与我相同的事情。他们可以按照自己的方式去帮助他人，或者我们可以组成团队，共同解决人们缺乏追求所爱所需知识的问题。我注意到的是，一旦你找到了自己的目标，需要警惕的是不要因为它看起来太过宏大，比如要解决世界性问题，就望而却步。你可以与他人合作完成它，我要告诉你1+1等于11。记住，一旦你明确了自己的目标，就可以寻找志同道合的人、社群和传统部落，与他们一起解决这个问题。但如果你不知道自己的目标是什么，你就不会这样做，最终会陷入为别人的目标而工作的困境。

Someone else's destiny, and I promise you it's harder to work for someone else than work for yourself despite what you have been told. How to find a co-founder now? If you're someone that likes to work alone, you can skip this bit. But I would say to you before you do, make sure you understand the power of a co-founder. Sometimes we get caught in our own ignorance bubble. We think we know what we know, but you don't know what you don't know. So be cautious before you skip this section. You're absolutely sure that a co-founder cannot bring you value? I will tell you first why a co-founder brings you value. It's a bit like if you get a gym membership, you probably don't go to the gym. But if you have a buddy who goes to the gym every morning, you often have accountability and you go. For me, that's one of the number one reasons I love having a co-founder. Now there is a counterargument to having a co-founder you'll hear from many people, which is: why would you give up 50% of your company to have a co-founder? I personally would rather have

他人的命运，我向你保证，为他人工作比为自已工作更艰难，尽管你可能听过相反的说法。现在谈谈如何寻找联合创始人？如果你喜欢独自工作，可以跳过这部分。但在你跳过之前，我想提醒你，务必理解联合创始人的力量。有时我们会陷入自己的认知盲区。我们自以为明白所知之事，却不知晓未知之事。因此在跳过本节前请三思。你完全确定联合创始人不能为你带来价值吗？我先告诉你联合创始人为何能带来价值。这就像办理健身会员卡，你可能根本不会去健身房。但如果有伙伴每天早晨都去健身，你们之间就会形成责任约束，你也会跟着去。对我来说，这正是我青睐联合创始人的首要原因。当然关于联合创始人也存在反对意见，你会听到很多人说：为什么要放弃公司50%的股权来换取联合创始人？就我个人而言，我宁愿选择

I personally would rather have 50% of a business I enjoy that's successful than 100% of a nightmare and a failure. I honestly think with all my heart that if you get a co-founder, your life is better. How do you get a co-founder and what should you look out for is something I'm now going to cover. I want to say you have to think carefully about the equity structure. Later in this video I'm going to talk about equity and it's going to be important. It's going to connect back to this, but for now I'm just going to talk in this bit about how to get a co-founder. The first step is to identify what I said earlier: what do you love to do and what do you hate to do? Be honest, be clear. Hate and love. Once you've identified what you hate to do and what you love to do, you can identify what is the perfect co-founder because you want someone that has the opposite skill to you. But this is very important when looking for a co-founder. I'm going to put it as number

我个人宁愿拥有一家我喜欢的成功企业的50%股份，也不愿完全拥有一个噩梦般的失败企业。我真心实意地认为，如果你找到一个联合创始人，你的生活会更好。如何找到联合创始人以及需要注意什么，这就是我现在要讲的内容。我想说的是你必须仔细考虑股权结构。在本视频后面我会讲到股权问题，这很重要，会与此相关联。但现在我只讲如何找到联合创始人。第一步是明确我之前说的：你喜欢做什么，讨厌做什么？要诚实，要清楚。讨厌和喜欢。一旦你明确了自己讨厌做什么和喜欢做什么，你就能确定什么是完美的联合创始人，因为你需要一个与你技能互补的人。但在寻找联合创始人时这一点非常重要。我要把它列为第

I'm going to put it as number two: has the same moral code. This process of finding a co-founder is pretty much the process of probably finding a partner in life. You're going to spend a lot of time with this person. This person is going to become literally your business life partner, and if you do it right, it is for life. Like I have in business done businesses with people, and even when I've sold that company, I've done another business with them. If you get it right, it is a lifelong partnership. And so you want to make sure you're honest and clear about what you hate doing and what you love doing, so that the person comes in and works with you, one doesn't question you, crossover with you, lets you run your area and gives you respect. Equally, you have the same with what they do. You write down exactly in detail what this person looks like, and I would go as far as to say you write down how tall they are, what they look like, how they speak, their background, where they're from, everything you can possibly think of, just as if you're picking a partner in life.

我要把它列为第二点：拥有相同的道德准则。寻找联合创始人的过程基本上就像寻找人生伴侣的过程。你会和这个人共度很多时光。这个人实际上会成为你的商业生活伴侣，如果处理得当，这种关系将持续一生。就像我在商业中与人合作一样，即使我卖掉了那家公司，我仍然会和他们开展另一项业务。如果处理得当，这就是终身伙伴关系。因此，你要确保诚实清楚地表达自己讨厌做什么和喜欢做什么，这样对方加入后与你合作时，不会质疑你，能够与你交叉协作，让你负责自己的领域并给予尊重。同样地，你也要对他们所做的工作给予同样的尊重。你要详细写下这个人的特征，我甚至要说，你要写下他们的身高、外貌、谈吐方式、背景、来自哪里，所有你能想到的细节，就像选择人生伴侣一样。

What is it you're looking for? Write down every detail. The reason I say the more detailed you are with it, the more likely you are to manifest it. You aren't going to be looking out for something unless you make it very clear what you're looking for. I mean it's the red car theory, right? If I suddenly tell you the words red car, you're probably going to see a lot of red cars. But if I don't mention red cars, you probably haven't seen one at all today. You have to list out what you want. So you've identified what you love doing and what you don't love doing. You've identified your own moral code. A moral code I can go into it a little bit more, it's quite a complicated thing. But there is one quick hack on this I can give you. Whenever I'm trying to find out whether or not someone's good, I don't care about money, I care about reputation. So I don't want to accidentally end up working with someone that all they really care about is money. And I have this test to check. I will say to them what if

你在寻找什么？写下每个细节。我说越详细越容易实现的原因是，除非你非常清楚自己在寻找什么，否则你不会去留意它。我指的是红车理论，对吧？如果我突然对你说"红车"这个词，你可能会看到很多红车。但如果我不提红车，你今天可能一辆都没注意到。你必须列出你想要的东西。所以你已经确定了自己喜欢做什么和不喜欢做什么。你已经确定了自己的道德准则。关于道德准则我可以再深入一点，这是个相当复杂的事情。但我可以给你一个快速判断的方法。每当我试图判断某人是否可靠时，我不在乎金钱，我在乎声誉。所以我不想意外地与那些只在乎金钱的人共事。我有个测试方法。我会对他们说如果

What if from this day until you're 70? So let's say you're 30 now. In the next 40 years, you'll have the most amazing life: three houses, one in New York, one in Hong Kong, one in London. Anywhere you go, people will love you. Private jets, everything you need for the next 40 years. That's your life. And in 40 years time, however, there is a catch: you'll get to 70 and then everyone will find out that you're a financial fraud, that you tricked people to get here, and that your life generally will be very different. People will look at you differently. Maybe then you'll die and maybe it doesn't matter, but that's your life. Do you want to take the deal? I'm surprised how many people say yes. I would say 50/50 people say yes. They take that deal: they'll have 40 years of a good life for a bad reputation at the end.

如果从现在开始直到你70岁呢？假设你现在30岁。在接下来的40年里，你将拥有最精彩的人生：三栋房子，一栋在纽约，一栋在香港，一栋在伦敦。无论你去哪里，人们都会喜爱你。私人飞机，未来40年所需的一切。这就是你的人生。然而40年后有个陷阱：当你70岁时，所有人都会发现你是个金融诈骗犯，你欺骗他人获得这一切，你的生活将彻底改变。人们会以不同的眼光看待你。也许那时你会死去，也许这并不重要，但这就是你的人生。你愿意接受这个交易吗？我很惊讶有多少人选择同意。大概有一半的人会接受这个交易：他们用最终身败名裂的代价换取40年的美好生活。

Be careful what people like, because that is what happens in my brain. Right? Because that is the Murdoch story. That is what Murdoch did. His son committed suicide, his name is in the dirt, no one ever wants to hear that name again in their life, and a lot of people were hurt. So I use open questions and philosophy to figure out whether or not it's someone I want to work with, and you should do it too. Because you don't want to be in partnership with someone that doesn't care in the same way that you care. I'm not here to judge what is right and what is wrong. I'm here to tell you how you can check that what's right for you aligns in your business, in your culture of your business, and more importantly in your day-to-day personal life. So you've identified what you love and what you don't love. You've checked the moral code in every way you can for the person you want. You've drawn lines in the sand for what you're not willing to do, and you know what this person looks like.

要小心人们喜欢什么，因为这就是我大脑里发生的事情。对吧？因为那就是默多克的故事。那就是默多克的所作所为。他的儿子自杀了，他的名字被玷污了，没有人愿意在生活中再听到那个名字，很多人都受到了伤害。所以我用开放式问题和哲学来思考这是否是我想合作的人，你也应该这样做。因为你不想和一个与你关心方式不同的人合作。我不是来评判什么是对什么是错的。我是来告诉你如何确认适合你的事物与你的业务、你的企业文化，更重要的是与你的日常个人生活相一致。所以你已经明确了自己喜欢什么和不喜欢什么。你已经尽一切可能检查了理想对象的道德准则。你已经划清了不愿做的事情的界限，并且你知道这个人应该是什么样子。

You look out for it in cafes when you're out having dinner, when you're at the supermarket you look out for this person because they're out there. You just have to have your eyes wide open. Of course you can go on help bank.com and ask people if they know someone like this. You can use the tools around you to get what you need, but ultimately you've now set yourself up with every chance of finding a co-founder. Now you're going to have to sort out the equity structure and get that right. I'm going to come to that in a minute, but that is how you find a co-founder. And in my opinion, it's one of the most powerful things you can do to ensure success in your business. Next up, how to sell. Now anybody can sell. It's a system, it's a philosophy, and anyone can do it. I don't care your background, you can be an introvert, you can still sell and understand the systems of selling. And if you are presently selling, I promise you you are missing a few tricks I'm going to try and help you with now. First up, how to sell. It's not what you have been taught.

在咖啡馆用餐时你要留意，在超市购物时你要留意，因为这样的人就在那里。你只需要睁大眼睛仔细观察。当然你可以登录help bank.com询问是否有人认识这样的人。你可以利用身边的工具获得所需，但最终你已经为自己创造了找到联合创始人的所有机会。现在你需要处理好股权结构并确保其合理。我稍后会详细说明这一点，但这就是你找到联合创始人的方法。在我看来，这是确保企业成功最有效的方法之一。接下来，如何销售。任何人都可以销售。这是一套系统，一种哲学，任何人都能做到。我不在乎你的背景，即使你性格内向，你仍然可以销售并理解销售体系。如果你目前正在销售，我敢保证你错过了一些技巧，我现在就要帮你解决。首先，如何销售。这与你以往学到的不同。

it is not here's my product this is how much it is and this is what it does. The first thing in sales that you need to learn and the number one thing I learned through the hard way of doing it is sell the sizzle not the steak. So what does that mean? Well let's pick one of the best products ever sold: Apple products. Steve Jobs used to always set up events where he'd invite 3,500 people into a room, all the right Tech reporters, all the right people, and he would then present to them the sizzle. He would not say here's a phone with an Intel processor that has this and has that. He would talk about how this product was for the game changers, for those that wanted to do things differently, for the creative types. He was very specific about what the sizzle is. He didn't sell the steak. Now in that process of selling there's a couple of other lessons that Steve Job teaches us. Of course he doesn't sell to Millions through social media. He picks a community 3,500 people in a room he sells to them he connects to them he talks to them.

这不是简单介绍产品、价格和功能。销售中你需要学习的第一件事，也是我通过艰难实践领悟到的首要法则：卖的是滋滋声，不是牛排。这是什么意思？让我们以史上最畅销的产品之一为例：苹果产品。史蒂夫·乔布斯总是举办特别活动，邀请3500人来到现场，包括所有重要的科技记者和关键人物，然后向他们展示产品的魅力。他不会直接说这是一款搭载英特尔处理器、具备各种功能的手机。他会谈论这款产品如何为变革者服务，为那些想要打破常规的人，为创意型人群而设计。他对产品的核心吸引力有着精准的把握。他不卖实质产品本身。在这个销售过程中，乔布斯还教会了我们其他几个经验。他当然不会通过社交媒体向数百万人推销。他选择在一个房间里向3500人的特定群体进行销售，与他们建立联系，直接对话。

He sells to them, he connects to them, he talks to them, and they go and talk to the rest of the world. Getting someone on your side selling for you is one of the most powerful ways to sell. The number one salesperson in my last company was my accountant. Why? Because I gave her the tools to sell. I told her what we did and how we did it. I showed her the sizzle through the numbers. We helped clients be more successful. We helped businesses stave off bankruptcy. We made sure companies did well, and she was proud of that. She would sell the sizzle. She'd sit with her other CFO friends at lunch and say, "We saved a company from going bankrupt. We made one company an extra million pounds a month they didn't expect." She would tell people the outcome. She wouldn't say, "Oh, I work for Fluid and we have marketing ideas." That's not exciting. She talked about the results. She talked about the philosophy, the sizzle. The second element of learning to sell is understanding the process of selling. So many people don't. So many people start on what I call the third step, and you need to do two steps first.

他向他们推销，与他们建立联系，与他们交谈，然后他们再去和世界其他地方的人交谈。让支持你的人为你推销是最有效的销售方式之一。我上一家公司的头号销售员是我的会计师。为什么？因为我给了她销售的工具。我告诉她我们做什么以及如何做。我通过数字向她展示了精彩之处。我们帮助客户取得更大成功。我们帮助企业避免破产。我们确保公司运营良好，她为此感到自豪。她会推销精彩之处。她会和其他首席财务官朋友共进午餐时说："我们拯救了一家公司免于破产。我们让一家公司每月多赚了一百万英镑，这是他们没想到的。"她会告诉人们结果。她不会说："哦，我在Fluid工作，我们有营销想法。"那并不令人兴奋。她谈论的是结果。她谈论的是理念，是精彩之处。学习销售的第二要素是理解销售过程。很多人都没有做到。很多人从我所说的第三步开始，而你需要先完成前两步。

Before you ever start implementing the third step in sales, the first step in any sales is to understand your customer. Now it sounds so obvious, and I'm shocked how many people don't do it. I often get emails that say "Dear John" or they say "Dear Simon, I really love what you're doing X" and they haven't actually researched what I'm really doing. However, when someone sends me something and understands what I'm doing, it's clear how they can bring value to me. I sit up and I listen. That is the number one thing that people don't do in the first step of sales: enough research. They do not spend enough time understanding if the person they're talking to actually needs them. They spend way too much time selling to people that don't actually need what they got to sell. Don't waste your time with people that don't need what you've got. Focus on the people that do need what you've got. The first step is: do they need you? Get to know them. The second step in this three-step process to get any sales done is to understand the person you're working with in the context of do

在你开始实施销售第三步之前，任何销售的第一步都是了解你的客户。这听起来如此显而易见，但令我震惊的是有多少人没有做到这一点。我经常收到写着"亲爱的约翰"或"亲爱的西蒙，我真的很喜欢你正在做的X"的邮件，而他们实际上并没有研究我真正在做什么。然而，当有人给我发送信息并理解我的工作时，他们如何能为我带来价值就变得清晰明了。我会坐直身子认真倾听。这就是人们在销售第一步中最常忽略的事情：充分调研。他们没有花足够时间去了解他们正在交谈的对象是否真正需要他们。他们花了太多时间向那些实际上并不需要他们产品的人推销。不要把时间浪费在不需要你产品的人身上。专注于那些确实需要你产品的人。第一步是：他们需要你吗？去了解他们。在这个三步销售流程中，完成任何销售任务的第二步是在具体情境中理解你正在合作的对象

In the context of sales, this element is so powerful. If you can have a real connection with the person you're selling to, a genuine connection, not a fake connection, it is something that will help you get through all sorts of difficult times in that relationship. You need to like each other, you need to genuinely like each other. If you meet someone who needs what you have, but they don't like you and you don't like them, the sale probably won't go ahead. But even worse, the sale might go ahead, then you'll be working with someone that doesn't like you and you don't like them. If they're rude, they're abrupt, you go out for dinner and they're rude to the waiter, if it doesn't appeal to you, drop them. Do not work with these people. It might be hard, you might want the revenue, but I promise you, you will not build a business that will last if you sell to the wrong people. So first step: do they need you, do you need them? Second step: do they like you, do you like them? If you do these two things well, the final step

在销售情境中，这个要素极其重要。如果你能与销售对象建立真正的联系，真诚的而非虚假的联系，这将帮助你们度过关系中各种艰难时刻。你们需要相互喜欢，需要真诚地欣赏彼此。如果你遇到需要你产品的人，但彼此互不喜欢，交易很可能无法达成。但更糟糕的是，即使交易达成，你将不得不与不喜欢你、你也不喜欢的人共事。如果他们粗鲁无礼、举止唐突，比如共进晚餐时对服务员态度恶劣，若这种行为令你反感，就应放弃合作。不要与这类人共事。这可能很困难，你可能想要这笔收入，但我向你保证，如果选错了客户，你将无法建立持久的事业。所以第一步：他们是否需要你，你是否需要他们？第二步：他们是否喜欢你，你是否喜欢他们？如果这两点都能做好，最后一步

If you do these two things well, the final step, and let's call it the deal, will happen. Because they like you and they need you, they will work with you to make a deal happen. I have done enormous deals every single time in my career when I've done the first two steps right. It's no problem. In fact, I have said how much I would like for a contract, and that client has come back to me and given me even more, told me the budget, and given me insight into how to make sure we get the work. So it's so important not just to go in there cold with what you've got to sell, but to go in there understanding the person and making sure it lasts. If you follow these three steps, I promise you you'll get every single sale done. Now there's one more final thing I want to tell you about sales: you've got to think long term. There was a study done by Harvard. They analyzed the best sales people in the world, and the top 50 salespeople in the world would on average approach someone to get a deal done five times. They would send them an email, for example, and

如果你做好这两件事，最后一步——我们称之为交易——就会水到渠成。因为他们喜欢你且需要你，他们会与你合作促成交易。在我的职业生涯中，只要前两步做对，每次都能达成巨额交易。这完全不是问题。事实上，当我提出期望的合同金额时，客户反而会给予更多，告知预算详情，并提供确保我们获得项目的建议。所以重要的不是带着待售产品贸然拜访，而是要理解对方需求并建立持久关系。如果你遵循这三个步骤，我保证你能完成每一笔销售。关于销售还有最后一点：你必须具备长远眼光。哈佛大学曾进行一项研究，他们分析了全球最优秀的销售人员，发现世界前50名的销售精英平均会接触客户五次来达成交易。例如他们会发送邮件，

They would send them an email, for example, and then a few weeks later they'd send them a follow-up email. Then maybe they'd send them a brochure or contact them through social media. They would basically contact a maximum of five times before they would actually consider that lead dead, and that was their mistake. We're talking about the leading sales people, the top 1% of sales people, which it turns out I am one of these people. I didn't know it at the time, I now know it looking at the research. The top 1% of salespeople do something very different. When I started Fluid, I wrote down all 50 companies I wanted to work with in the building of this business, and there were big names on there. From day one, I built a system to reach out to them by hook or by crook in some way every single month. For example, at Christmas I would wish them a merry Christmas and send them a card. At Chinese New Year I'd send them something. When I learned something about their industry that I thought could be useful to them, a bit of research, I would send it to them. I would always make sure every single month

例如，他们会先发送一封电子邮件，几周后再发送一封跟进邮件。然后可能会寄送宣传册或通过社交媒体联系他们。他们基本上最多联系五次就会认定该潜在客户无效，而这正是他们的错误所在。我们谈论的是顶尖销售人员，即前1%的销售人员，而事实证明我就是其中之一。当时我并不知道这一点，现在通过研究我才明白。前1%的销售人员采取了截然不同的做法。当我创立Fluid时，我列出了50家我希望在业务发展中合作的公司，其中不乏知名企业。从第一天起，我就建立了一个系统，想方设法每月与他们取得联系。例如，圣诞节时我会祝福他们圣诞快乐并寄送贺卡。中国新年时我会寄送礼物。当我了解到他们行业的某些信息，认为可能对他们有用时，我会将相关研究成果发送给他们。我始终确保每个月

I would always make sure every single month I made contact with them in some way, not to sell necessarily but to build a relationship, to get to know what their needs were. In some cases I got those clients quite quick, but in the majority of the businesses it took me, for example, 9 years to get some of those companies on board. Every single month for many years I would approach those companies, and that's the secret to it. It's a long game. You have to apply yourself, build a system in sales that lasts. It cannot be one email they don't reply to, or one email and they say no. You've got to keep staying in contact with them. Building things like email lists are still very powerful. I know it's not as cool these days as being popular on TikTok, but I promise you having an email list where you can contact that person regularly, keep an update of what you're doing, keep up to date with what they're doing, will ensure a sale at some point in the future as long as you're politely persistent. I promise you, you follow these rules in sales, your life will change.

我总是确保每个月都以某种方式与他们联系，不一定是为了销售，而是为了建立关系，了解他们的需求。有些情况下我很快就能获得这些客户，但在大多数企业中，我花了很长时间，比如9年才让一些公司加入。多年来我每个月都会联系这些公司，这就是成功的秘诀。这是一场持久战。你必须全力以赴，建立一个持久的销售体系。不能因为他们不回复一封邮件，或者一封邮件被拒绝就放弃。你必须持续与他们保持联系。建立邮件列表这样的方法仍然非常有效。我知道如今这不像在TikTok上走红那么酷，但我向你保证，拥有一个可以定期联系对方的邮件列表，及时更新你的动态，了解他们的进展，只要你保持礼貌的坚持，最终一定会促成销售。我向你保证，如果你遵循这些销售规则，你的生活将会改变。

I will add in sales people don't bring their personality into the mix enough. You've got to be yourself, be honest, be authentic in sales. It's not about selling someone a car that doesn't work. That is how people are projecting what sales looks like. Sales is about selling someone a car they actually need. I have seen in my own life when I've gone to buy a car, the best salespeople tell me "You don't want this car, you want that car in another showroom" where they don't get the commission. I've actually had that happen and when I saw that happen I hired that person because that person is thinking longterm. They're not trying to sell me a car to make the commission, they're building a relationship with me and that is what you need to do to be successful in sales.

我要补充的是，销售人员往往没有充分展现自己的个性。在销售中，你必须做真实的自己，保持诚实和真诚。销售不是向别人推销一辆有问题的车。这是人们对销售的刻板印象。销售的本质是向客户提供他们真正需要的车。在我自己的购车经历中，我见过最好的销售人员告诉我："您不想要这辆车，您应该去另一个展厅看看那辆车"，而他们却拿不到佣金。我确实遇到过这种情况，当我看到这种情况时，我雇佣了那个人，因为那个人考虑的是长远发展。他们不是为了赚取佣金而向我推销汽车，而是在与我建立关系，这正是你在销售领域取得成功所需要做的。

next up how to Market this is a deep subject but I'm going to try and give you all the knowledge I've gained in decades of building some of the most complicated marketing structures there is now marketing is one of the most important pieces in making a business work and I when I think about this subject it's

So complicated. I honestly think because I know everything about this subject, it's like rocket science. I will start off perhaps by teaching you that in marketing, 50% of what you spend will probably be wasted. So if you've got a million views but the wrong views, it's wasted. So marketing is about really experimenting. Now I mentioned earlier when I'm talking about sales, sell the sizzle not the steak. Of course that applies in marketing too. But marketing is actually about connecting with people over time. The biggest example is branding. If you get the branding right, people will resonate. You're probably a victim of this. You would rather buy an Apple than an off brand, right? You've become a victim of good marketing. And when for example the iPod launched, product people all thought the product did the selling. It was such a good product, that's why it did so well. No, when they launched the iPod, they spent more money marketing that product than any company had ever spent on marketing a product ever. Marketing is not one thing. Marketing is a complex structure combining PR, brand messaging, product market fit.

这太复杂了。说实话，因为我对这个领域了如指掌，它就像火箭科学一样深奥。或许我可以先告诉你，在营销中，你投入的50%资金可能都会被浪费掉。所以如果你获得了一百万次浏览量，但都是无效浏览量，那就是浪费。因此营销实际上就是不断实验的过程。之前我在讨论销售时提到过，要卖的是滋滋声而不是牛排本身。这当然也适用于营销。但营销实际上是关于与人们建立长期联系。最典型的例子就是品牌建设。如果你把品牌做好了，人们就会产生共鸣。你可能就是这种现象的受害者。你宁愿买苹果产品也不愿买杂牌货，对吧？你已经成为了优秀营销的受害者。比如当iPod推出时，产品团队都认为是产品本身带来了销量。他们认为产品如此出色，所以才卖得这么好。不对，当他们推出iPod时，他们在该产品上的营销投入比任何公司对任何产品的营销投入都要多。营销不是单一的事物。营销是一个复杂的结构体系，融合了公关、品牌传播、产品市场匹配度。

If you don't know product market fit, I can cover this later, but basically you've got to make sure that the people you're talking to will resonate to the product that you're selling or the service that you're selling. Marketing in my opinion is actually number one thing. It's understanding who your customer is. Now often in business build, you'll see businesses focus on niches to start with. Now it doesn't have to stay in that niche, but it's a great place to start. So Facebook for example, it started off in universities and by connecting people in universities. Of course now it became connected everybody all over the world, but they understood their customer. They knew what that customer was looking for. And in the early days of Facebook, they put a feature on there called single or available. I can't remember the exact terminology, but they basically created a feature that let you know if that person was in a relationship or not. And that was designed to help the university students understand the dynamics between their fellow university students. And so they knew their market audience and they then marketed that feature.

如果你不了解产品市场契合度，我可以稍后详细说明，但基本上你需要确保与你交流的人会对你销售的产品或服务产生共鸣。在我看来，营销实际上是最重要的事情。关键在于了解你的客户是谁。在创业过程中，你经常会看到企业最初专注于细分市场。虽然不必一直局限于这个细分市场，但这是一个很好的起点。以Facebook为例，它最初从大学起步，通过连接大学里的人。当然现在它已经连接了全世界的人，但他们了解自己的客户。他们知道客户在寻找什么。在Facebook早期，他们推出了一个名为"单身"或"可交往"的功能。我记不清确切的术语，但他们基本上创建了一个功能，让你知道那个人是否处于恋爱关系中。这个功能旨在帮助大学生了解同学间的人际关系动态。因此他们了解自己的目标受众，然后推广这个功能。

People would then go around saying, "Did you see Sarah? She's suddenly single," and that would be the marketing for their product. They built a tool in the platform that became what people spoke about, that created the marketing for you. And in my opinion, that's the Holy Grail of marketing. This brings me on to point two. I call this the staircase philosophy. So the best way for me to teach you this is to tell you what I have recently done. Weirdly, a few months ago, a staircase came up for sale in London. It's the first time a staircase had ever been for sale in London. It's ridiculous. And I heard it on the news that this staircase was for sale, and I told my brain instantly we're going to buy it. Now I didn't have an exact plan of what I was going to do with the staircase, but what I knew was that staircase symbolized something for my business, which was step by step you can get anywhere you want. But also I knew I could newsjack that staircase. It was a sensation. People didn't know why someone was selling a staircase.

人们会四处议论："你看到莎拉了吗？她突然恢复单身了"，这就成了他们产品的营销方式。他们在平台上打造的工具成为了人们谈论的话题，从而为你创造了营销效果。在我看来，这就是营销的终极境界。这引出了我的第二个观点，我称之为阶梯哲学。让我解释这个概念的最好方式，就是讲述我最近的经历。奇怪的是，几个月前，伦敦有个楼梯挂牌出售。这是伦敦首次有楼梯被出售，简直荒谬。我在新闻上看到这个楼梯正在出售，立即就告诉自己我们要买下它。当时我并没有想好具体要拿这个楼梯做什么，但我知道这个楼梯象征着我的商业理念——循序渐进就能抵达任何目标。同时我也知道我可以借这个楼梯制造新闻。它引起了轰动，人们都不明白为什么会有人出售楼梯。

and 2 days after hearing it on the news I owned it. I spent £26,000 buying it at auction. Then we did a couple of clever things that hopefully symbolize how marketing works. First up, as soon as we bought the staircase, the news channels that had reported it was for sale jumped on us. I knew they would, and they wanted to know why we had bought a staircase. That gave us an opportunity to get on the front page of the New York Times, on the front page of the BBC, in every single newspaper around the world. Millions of us worth of coverage for our platform because we bought a staircase. It doesn't seem relevant, but doing these wild things, these crazy things, can actually make a huge difference. One of the things that I always loved in marketing was when flash mobs were a thing. What happened was suddenly you'd get a whole shopping mall, people would start dancing, and everyone would wonder what it was. Right? That is brilliant marketing. Now it might not sell your product exactly in that exact moment, but over time it allows you to have a reach and expansion.

在新闻上听到它两天后，我就拥有了它。我花了26,000英镑在拍卖会上买下了它。然后我们做了几件巧妙的事情，希望能体现营销的运作方式。首先，我们刚买下楼梯，之前报道它出售的新闻频道就立刻盯上了我们。我知道他们会这样，他们想知道我们为什么买一个楼梯。这让我们有机会登上《纽约时报》头版、BBC头版，以及全世界每一份报纸。因为我们买了一个楼梯，为我们的平台赢得了价值数百万的报道。这看起来不相关，但做这些疯狂的事情实际上能产生巨大影响。我在营销中一直喜欢的现象之一是快闪活动盛行的时候。当时的情况是，突然整个购物中心的人开始跳舞，所有人都会好奇发生了什么。对吧？这才是出色的营销。它可能不会在当下直接推销你的产品，但随着时间的推移，它能让你获得影响力和扩张。

It allows you to have reach, expansion, and uniqueness that will help you stand out. Because that's what it's about - it's about standing out. So by buying the staircase, we then evolved it. We got all this PR, millions of dollars worth of free PR for a staircase. Then we put a doorbell at the bottom of that staircase and we said if you've got a dream, press a button. We'll then upload your dream to our 4 million following and get you free exposure. Well, that was what the Press needed to do a follow-up story on. Once you bought the staircase, what did you do with it? They wrote all about that. But also, we built a whole new way of helping people on the back of staircase that was for sale. I knew it symbolized helping people step by step. And then the final step in marketing: we all need partners. Marketing isn't about promoting something on your own. We want to get a partner like Ring doorbell or Amazon, who own Ring doorbell, on board to sponsor the doorbell, to sponsor the staircase, to help us reach even more people. And then suddenly they pay for our marketing.

它让你拥有影响力、扩展性和独特性，从而帮助你脱颖而出。因为这正是关键所在——就是要与众不同。通过购买楼梯，我们随后对其进行了升级改造。我们获得了所有这些公关资源，价值数百万美元的免费楼梯公关宣传。然后我们在楼梯底部安装了一个门铃，并宣布：如果你有梦想，就按下按钮。我们会将你的梦想上传给我们400万粉丝，为你获得免费曝光。这正是媒体需要跟进报道的内容。一旦你购买了楼梯，你会用它做什么？他们对此进行了全面报道。但更重要的是，我们基于待售的楼梯建立了一套全新的助人方式。我知道它象征着逐步帮助人们。然后是营销的最后一步：我们都需要合作伙伴。营销不是单打独斗地推广某物。我们希望与像Ring门铃或拥有Ring门铃的亚马逊这样的合作伙伴合作，让他们赞助门铃，赞助楼梯，帮助我们触达更多人群。然后突然间，他们为我们的营销买单。

that was for sale I knew it symbolized helping people step by step. Then the final step in marketing: we all need partners. Marketing isn't about promoting something on your own. We don't want to get a partner like Ring doorbell or Amazon who own Ring doorbell on board to sponsor the doorbell, to sponsor the staircase, to help us reach even more people. And then suddenly they pay for our marketing. So marketing isn't a standalone thing. Marketing isn't a non-living organic product. You have to see it as living, you have to see it as evolving, and you have to see it as something that you do that pushes the envelope. Now marketing is connected to sales. If you have a sales team, in a way when they ring someone up, how they speak to someone, how they treat someone, that is also marketing. That's brand marketing. However that person receives your phone call, receives your interaction with them, will affect your brand and that is marketing. Nike for example, how do they do marketing? Well they endorse the very best athletes in the world. Of course in some cases they make shoes with those very successful athletes. They're aligning themselves up with these people that are incredibly successful. What does Apple do? Apple links to creative people. So therefore everybody wants to have some sort of creativity in their life, beauty in their life. So they buy a product they think is for the creative people. Right? IBM notebook was a better product but people didn't want that. It didn't symbolize something cool.

这件待售的商品象征着帮助人们一步步前进。而营销的最后一步是：我们都需要合作伙伴。营销不是单打独斗地推广某样东西。我们不需要找像Ring门铃或拥有Ring的亚马逊这样的合作伙伴来赞助门铃、赞助楼梯，以帮助我们触达更多人群。然后突然间他们为我们的营销买单。所以营销不是孤立存在的事物。营销不是无生命的有机产品。你必须将其视为有生命的、不断进化的，并且是推动变革的行为。营销与销售紧密相连。如果你有销售团队，他们打电话时的沟通方式、对待客户的态度，同样属于营销范畴。这就是品牌营销。对方接听你电话的方式、与你互动的体验，都会影响你的品牌形象——这就是营销。以耐克为例，他们如何做营销？他们签约全球最顶尖的运动员。当然有时他们会与这些成功运动员联名打造鞋款。他们与这些极其成功的人士建立联盟。苹果又怎么做？苹果与创意人士建立关联。因此每个人都希望在生活中拥有创意元素和美感，于是购买他们认为专为创意人群设计的产品。IBM笔记本本是更优质的产品，但人们并不想要，因为它没有象征酷炫的特质。

Marketing is about selling the sizzle, but it's also about understanding who your customer is, how to reach that niche, and then how to work with that niche to expand into the wider world. If you want to scale, it's the staircase method: what's your staircase, what's going to make you stand out, and how can you evolve that thing that makes you stand out and go even further. Number three is systems. When you're doing marketing, it is such an overwhelming thing. There are so many different ways you can do it: email marketing, social media, PR, branding, events. The list never ends. So how do you decide which one to do? First of all, whatever you do, you've got to build a system to do it. If it is email marketing, then you have a good data collection system, you have a good data management system, and then you have a good way of pushing out the content to that database.

营销不仅仅是销售产品亮点，还包括了解你的客户是谁、如何触达特定细分市场，以及如何利用该细分市场拓展至更广阔的范围。如果想要扩大规模，就需要采用阶梯方法：你的阶梯是什么，什么能让你脱颖而出，以及如何发展这种让你脱颖而出的特质并走得更远。第三点是系统化。进行市场营销时，这是一项令人应接不暇的工作。有太多不同的方式可以选择：电子邮件营销、社交媒体、公关、品牌建设、活动策划，这个清单永无止境。那么如何决定采用哪种方式呢？首先，无论选择哪种方式，都必须建立相应的系统来执行。如果是电子邮件营销，就需要有完善的数据收集系统、数据管理系统，以及向该数据库推送内容的有效方式。

and whatever one of these things you do, if you do all of them or you do one of them, do them well. Do not do all of them and order of them badly. I see so many people with on their website Twitter and Facebook and Instagram links, and then you click through to them and they're dead. You're better off doing one well. Now I think marketing is something where you should spread your bet. You want to do many different ways what I call entrances into your business. You want to do many of them as many of them as you can, but do not over stretch yourself. It's better to do one platform on social media really well than try and spread yourself thin. But if you set up a system for doing your social media, there is a chance you could do all of them well with the same amount of resources doing one of them well. So for example on my social media I have one core video and then we edit it in-app for each of the channels so we don't have to record separate videos for each of the channels but we do in-app edit them so they're

无论你做这些事情中的哪一件，无论是全部做还是只做其中一件，都要把它们做好。不要全部做却都做得很糟糕。我看到很多人在他们的网站上放了Twitter、Facebook和Instagram链接，但当你点击进去时，这些链接都是死链。你最好把一件事做好。我认为营销是需要分散投资的领域。你应该通过多种不同方式创造我所谓的"业务入口"。你要尽可能多地尝试各种方式，但不要过度扩张自己。在社交媒体上把一个平台真正做好，比试图全面铺开却力不从心要好得多。但如果你建立了社交媒体运营系统，就有可能用做好一个平台所需的同等资源把所有的平台都做好。例如在我的社交媒体运营中，我们有一个核心视频，然后为每个渠道进行应用内编辑，这样我们就不必为每个渠道单独录制视频，而是通过应用内编辑使它们

So they're actually tailored to that particular platform's nuances, be it their font or their image. You can actually set up a system to do all of these marketing things, but the key of course is not only just systems but making sure you pick what works for you. Now when it comes to marketing, one of the big mistakes I see people get taught is marketing is about having the staircase only. It's not about having the staircase only. It is about applying what you like to do as a founder or maybe what your team likes to do into your marketing strategy. As an example, if you don't like talking on camera, that's not your thing, as long as you're not hiding away from learning something new and you genuinely don't like to do it. But for example, if you love to write, then doing an email marketing strategy is probably right for you. Posting on LinkedIn is probably the correct platform for you. Sure, you'll hear people talking about how good TikTok is and how much benefit they got from it, but if it doesn't work for you, it's not sustainable for you.

因此它们实际上是针对特定平台的细微差别量身定制的，无论是字体还是图像。你确实可以建立一个系统来处理所有这些营销事务，但关键当然不仅仅是系统，还要确保选择适合你的方式。在营销方面，我看到人们常被教导的一个重大错误是认为营销只需要有阶梯。这不仅仅是拥有阶梯的问题。而是要将你作为创始人喜欢做的事情，或者你的团队喜欢做的事情应用到你的营销策略中。举例来说，如果你不喜欢在镜头前讲话，只要你不是在逃避学习新事物，并且你真的不喜欢这样做，那这就不适合你。但如果你喜欢写作，那么制定电子邮件营销策略可能适合你。在LinkedIn上发帖可能是适合你的正确平台。当然，你会听到人们谈论TikTok有多好，以及他们从中获得了多少好处，但如果它不适合你，对你来说就不可持续。

It's not something you're going to enjoy, and marketing is something fun. This is something I want you to take away: no one talks about it, but marketing is meant to be fun. I took my son to buy that staircase, we had a laugh once we got the staircase, we had a laugh cleaning it up, we had a laugh putting a blimp on top of it, we had a laugh putting a doorbell on the front of it. We enjoyed the whole bloody thing, and if you don't enjoy it, what's the point? Marketing is about enjoying it. That's why I see brands do well. I give you an example: Starbucks marketing in the early days was two things. First, they would take good locations, sometimes quite close to each other. So instead of getting a billboard advertising Starbucks, they'd open up another Starbucks. And even if it was loss-making, as long as it wasn't more expensive in its loss than a billboard, they were better off having a store. Then people could have the experience. They never did any billboards. It's changed now, and I would argue it's not as good a brand anymore.

这不是你会喜欢的事情，而营销是有趣的事情。我希望你们记住这一点：虽然没人谈论，但营销本该充满乐趣。我带我儿子去买那个楼梯，拿到楼梯时我们很开心，清理它时我们很开心，在顶部放上飞艇时我们很开心，在前面安装门铃时我们很开心。我们享受了整个过程的每一刻，如果你不享受它，那还有什么意义？营销就是要享受其中。这就是为什么我看到一些品牌做得很好。我给你们举个例子：早期的星巴克营销有两件事。首先，他们会选择好的位置，有时彼此相当接近。所以与其投放广告牌宣传星巴克，他们宁愿再开一家星巴克。即使亏损经营，只要亏损不超过广告牌的费用，他们开店的成本效益就更高。这样人们就能亲身体验。他们从不使用广告牌。现在情况已经改变，我认为它不再是一个那么好的品牌了。

But they opened up locations that was one of their marketing strategies. The second thing that they did that was really clever is they looked after their staff, which sounds really obvious doesn't it? But they did. They talk about their staff as partners, the Baristas are Partners. In some respects, the internal training manual talked about their Baristas as the customer and it worked in the early days of Starbucks. To say what you like about them today, but in the early days of Starbucks when I used to walk in there, a barista would know my name, they'd know what drink I wanted. And they were just working for Starbucks but they cared because they were looked after. They were given medical care for example, they were given full-time Medical Care even if they were part-time staff. They were given insurance and looked after and they were given days off if they didn't feel very well. They were looked after and I think that this is also part of marketing. It might not sound it, but if your people don't represent you then good luck making everything else represent you.

但他们开设门店是他们的营销策略之一。他们做的第二件非常聪明的事情是关心员工，这听起来很明显不是吗？但他们确实做到了。他们把员工称为合作伙伴，咖啡师就是合作伙伴。在某些方面，内部培训手册将咖啡师视为顾客，这在星巴克早期确实奏效。不管你现在对星巴克有什么看法，但在早期当我走进星巴克时，咖啡师会知道我的名字，知道我想喝什么饮料。他们虽然只是为星巴克工作，但他们很用心，因为他们受到了关怀。例如他们获得了医疗保障，即使是兼职员工也能获得全职医疗保障。他们获得了保险和照顾，如果感觉不舒服还可以休假。他们受到了关怀，我认为这也是营销的一部分。这听起来可能不像，但如果你的员工不能代表你，那么祝你好运让其他一切代表你。

Because those people will create all the things that represent you, so do include fun into your business. Do look at the nuances of your business and figure out what is going to be your staircase, and ultimately apply your marketing love to something that's sustainable, that's going to be enjoyable, that's going to be able to actually deliver the very thing that you want to deliver, which I think should always be the promise of a better future for your customers.

因为这些人将创造所有代表你的事物，所以请务必将乐趣融入你的业务。审视业务的细微差别，找出你的阶梯所在，最终将你的营销热情投入到可持续、令人愉悦、能够真正实现你想要传递的东西的事物上，我认为这应该始终是对客户更美好未来的承诺。

It had no impact on their business other than to make them feel good, which is fine I guess, but I do think PR should be more strategic. I'd rather spend time reaching the press and actually getting a tangible result and not just playing to echo. So recently for example, I was featured on the BBC news. They talked about what we were doing at the doorbell where people could pitch their dreams, and this led to hundreds of people finding out about it, going to our staircase, pitching their dream and helping them make their dream happen. Now that in my opinion is targeted marketing. Equally, I have done recently an article in a Business Journal that got zero reaction. Now I was proud to be in the Business Journal and I don't want to say which one it is so I don't insult them, but ultimately it actually led to no value as far as what I want to do, which is help people do what they love and make sure people know there's a service out there for free to help them do what they love. So PR is very important to be targeted, and so I'll write that down first.

除了让他们感觉良好之外，这对他们的业务没有任何影响，这倒也无妨，但我确实认为公关应该更具策略性。我宁愿花时间接触媒体并获得实际成果，而不是仅仅为了迎合而做。例如最近，我上了BBC新闻。他们报道了我们在门铃处开展的活动，人们可以在那里讲述自己的梦想，这导致数百人了解到这个活动，来到我们的楼梯间，讲述他们的梦想并帮助他们实现梦想。在我看来，这就是有针对性的营销。同样地，我最近在一家商业杂志上发表了一篇文章，但完全没有引起反响。我为能登上那家商业杂志感到自豪，也不想具体说是哪家以免冒犯他们，但就我想要实现的目标——帮助人们做他们热爱的事情，并确保人们知道有一项免费服务可以帮助他们实现所爱——而言，这实际上没有带来任何价值。因此，公关必须要有针对性，这一点非常重要，所以我要首先把它记下来。

You could spend a lot of time and money reaching those people and then not get coverage. The second thing I'll teach you about PR is journalists are lazy. If you understand this and provide everything for them, then they don't need to do any work and are more likely to give you press coverage. What I always do is write the press release like it's the actual story I want written, with a good headline that makes them happy. Journalists don't want to write and sell you; they want to write something interesting for the reader. So I create a good subject line that's good for the reader, make the story good for the reader, and do all the work for the journalist. Then with things like photos, I take high-resolution photos and send them with a press clip to ensure they have everything they need. All they have to do is say yes to the story and put their own touch on it. Job done. They're human beings who want to go out for lunch if they can, so if you can make it possible for

你可能会花费大量时间和金钱去接触那些人却得不到报道。我要教你的第二点关于公关的是记者都很懒。如果你理解这一点并为他们准备好一切，他们就不需要做任何工作，更有可能给你新闻报道。我通常的做法是把新闻稿写成我想要的实际报道那样，配上能让他们开心的好标题。记者不想为你写宣传稿，他们想写对读者有趣的内容。所以我创作对读者有益的好标题，让故事对读者有吸引力，为记者完成所有工作。至于照片这类东西，我会拍摄高分辨率照片，连同新闻稿一起发送，确保他们拥有所需的一切。他们只需要同意这个故事并加上自己的润色就完成了。他们是普通人，如果可能的话都想出去吃午餐，所以如果你能让

If you can make it possible for them to go out for lunch and do their job, then you will win in PR. Too many people are lazy. They send press releases that are generic and don't tailor them to the journalist they're writing to. The other thing you need to do is research that journalist back to the targeting. You need to understand what that journalist writes about, what that journalist is interested in, and almost write in their style if you want that particular journalist to write about you. The third thing on PR I'll tell you is there are a lot of companies out there that will tell you they can get you PR. Please be careful now. As much as it might be nice to just pay someone to do this, I have discovered doing the PR yourself, especially if you're a small business, can pay huge dividends. Why? Because you can make a relationship direct with a journalist. How do you find these journalistic contacts? That's what the PR companies tell you they've got. You can go for a newspaper and find them. You can Google them. You'll find them quite quick. One big hack I'll give you is Twitter.

如果你能让他们外出吃午餐并完成工作，那么你就能在公关中获胜。太多人太懒惰了。他们发送通用的新闻稿，没有针对他们正在联系的记者进行定制。你需要做的另一件事是研究那位记者，回归到目标定位。你需要了解那位记者写什么，那位记者对什么感兴趣，如果你想让那位特定记者写关于你的内容，你几乎要用他们的风格来写。我要告诉你的关于公关的第三点是，有很多公司会告诉你他们能为你争取到公关。现在请小心。尽管付钱让别人做这件事可能很省事，但我发现自己做公关，特别是如果你是一家小企业，可以带来巨大的回报。为什么？因为你可以直接与记者建立关系。你如何找到这些记者联系方式？这就是公关公司告诉你他们拥有的资源。你可以找一份报纸找到他们。你可以用谷歌搜索他们。你会很快找到他们。我要告诉你的一个大技巧是推特。

One big hack I'll give you is Twitter in particular is really good to get hold of journalists. If you start following the journalists that you want to write about you and you start engaging on their posts, I would say that's one of the best ways to start building up a relationship with a journalist. Most people will reply to comment or read a comment that you've made on one of their posts. Weirdly enough, often journalists don't have big followings and they don't actually have a lot of comments, so you can start making a relationship. Start commenting on something if they post something about global warming and you've got a product that's helping reduce global warming, then you will get noticed. If you start commenting on a story they've done about it, start being part of their thinking when it comes to "I need someone to help me write this story, I need someone to give me a quote to make the story better". Start becoming part of that journalist life, and it starts with just following them on Twitter or replying to one of their comments, engaging on one of the stories they've already written.

我要告诉你的一个重要技巧是，Twitter特别适合联系记者。如果你开始关注那些你想让他们报道你的记者，并开始在他们的帖子上互动，我会说这是与记者建立关系的最佳方式之一。大多数人会回复评论或阅读你在他们帖子上的留言。奇怪的是，记者通常粉丝不多，实际上也没有很多评论，所以你可以开始建立关系。如果他们发布了关于全球变暖的内容，而你有一个有助于减少全球变暖的产品，那么开始评论就会引起注意。如果你开始评论他们写的相关报道，当他们思考"我需要有人帮我写这篇报道，我需要有人给我提供引用来让报道更精彩"时，你就能成为他们考虑的一部分。开始成为那位记者生活的一部分，这只需从在Twitter上关注他们或回复他们的评论开始，参与他们已写的报道互动。

Even online, things like Daily Mail, the journalist will read the comment on their own story. So engage, engage is the number one thing I can tell you when it comes to getting PR from journalists. And finally, I have been involved in many conversations where I know brands have not worked with someone because they saw on someone's social media that they posted something obscene or rude or stupid. Remember that you as a business owner will always be the number one PR engine. Whatever you post up, be conscious, be careful, think about your brand, think about the image that you're projecting. And I can't tell you enough how important this is, because if you do the first few things I've just mentioned, you connect with the press, you know who you're targeting and you're not lazy, you help them do it. If a journalist sees that you are out of control or inappropriate, they will not risk their job to write about you. So learn to be disciplined, learn to be the brand. PR starts with one person having respect for you, so make sure you're disciplined, don't be lazy yourself.

即使在网络上，像《每日邮报》这样的媒体，记者也会阅读自己报道下的评论。所以互动，互动是我能告诉你在获取记者公关方面最重要的事情。最后，我参与过很多对话，知道品牌因为看到某人在社交媒体上发布了淫秽、粗鲁或愚蠢的内容而拒绝合作。记住，作为企业主，你永远是最重要的公关引擎。无论你发布什么内容，都要保持清醒、谨慎，考虑你的品牌，考虑你正在塑造的形象。我无法充分强调这有多重要，因为如果你做到了我刚才提到的前几点——与媒体建立联系、明确目标对象、不懒惰、协助他们工作——那么当记者发现你失控或不妥当时，他们不会冒着丢掉工作的风险来报道你。所以要学会自律，学会成为品牌。公关始于一个人对你的尊重，所以请确保你自律，不要自己懒惰。

Next up, one of my favorite subjects and one of the questions I get asked the most: how to get an investor. Learning how to get an investor can dramatically change the trajectory of your business. Equally though, just before I go into how to get an investor, I want you to think carefully about whether or not you need an investor. I have invested in 78 companies. You can go on my website simon.com and look at some of the companies I've invested in. I have seen it all, and sometimes if you get the wrong investor or get an investor for the wrong reasons, you will have a new boss and your life will become a nightmare. It will be easy at the beginning when you get the money, and will get harder over time if you do it wrong. I will try to teach you how to not get it wrong, but equally please ask yourself: is there another way to make the business work? I'm going to touch on other ways that you could make it work even if you don't get an investor within this "how to get an investor" chat.

接下来是我最喜欢的话题之一，也是我被问得最多的问题之一：如何获得投资者。学会如何获得投资者能够显著改变你企业的发展轨迹。但同样重要的是，在我深入讲解如何获得投资者之前，我希望你仔细思考是否真的需要投资者。我已经投资了78家公司。你可以访问我的网站simon.com查看我投资过的一些公司。我见过各种情况，有时候如果你找错了投资者，或者出于错误的原因寻找投资者，你就会多一个新老板，你的生活将变成一场噩梦。刚开始拿到钱时会很容易，但如果处理不当，随着时间的推移会变得越来越困难。我会教你如何避免犯错，但同样请扪心自问：是否有其他方式能让企业运转下去？在这次关于"如何获得投资者"的讨论中，我也会提及即使没有投资者也能让企业运转的其他方法。

Depending on the stage of your business and how much you're trying to raise, there are quite a few different ways to get an investor. If you're trying to raise money in the early days of a business, I would say the more traction you have in your business, the easier it is to get an investor. That does not mean if you just have an idea you can't get an investor - you definitely can - there's just less people that will fund it. Just like the sales stuff I taught you earlier, it's probably better to make sure that you actually know who you're targeting when you're getting an investor. What is the profile of the person you want? If you're going after someone that perhaps will fund a business that has no traction, it's just an idea, then remember those people's profile. They probably want quite a lot of equity, they probably want some involvement in the business to make sure it works, and they probably want some sector relevance or industry relevance to your business so they can add value. Because no investor, I don't care who they are, just wants to feel like money. Everybody wants to feel like they're bringing some sort

根据企业所处阶段和融资目标的不同，获取投资者的途径有多种。若在企业初创期寻求融资，业务增长势头越强劲，吸引投资者就越容易。但这并非意味着仅凭创意就无法获得投资——你确实可以——只是愿意出资的人会相对较少。正如我之前讲授的销售策略，寻找投资者时最好明确你的目标对象。你期望的投资者具备何种特质？若你寻求的对象可能投资尚无业绩验证、仅停留在创意阶段的项目，请记住这类投资者的特征：他们往往要求较高股权比例，希望参与企业运营以确保项目成功，并且倾向于选择与自身行业背景相关的领域进行投资，从而能够创造附加价值。因为无论何种投资者，都不希望自己仅仅被视为资金来源。每个人都希望自己能够带来某种

Of value beyond just the money, so they probably want some sector relevance or industry relevance to your business so they can add value. Because no investor, I don't care who they are, just wants to feel like money. Everybody wants to feel like they're bringing some sort of value. In fact, I would argue you shouldn't invest in a business unless you can bring value. You've got to make the value the thing that gives you the edge to make that investment work, otherwise you might just invest in the stock market. If you can't bring value, you might as well invest in the stock market. And I don't think you make money from the stock market. Middle class people make money from the stock market. You make money like Warren Buffett makes money - you own a piece of a company you can influence, you can help make sure it's successful. So do your research, but these are the types of profiles that are often the best: family and friends. Now I know family and friends can be difficult for a lot of people. A lot of people don't have family and friends with money, and I totally understand that, and I'll come to other methods. But I just want to touch on this first because family and friends - the reason it's such a good thing to do is because they know you. You don't have to convince someone of your personality, your profile, your dedication.

除了金钱之外的价值，所以他们可能希望与你的业务有一定的行业相关性，这样他们才能增加价值。因为没有投资者——我不在乎他们是谁——仅仅想感觉自己只是金钱。每个人都希望感觉自己正在带来某种价值。事实上，我认为除非你能带来价值，否则你不应该投资一家企业。你必须让价值成为让你在投资中占据优势的因素，否则你不如直接投资股市。如果你不能带来价值，你还不如投资股市。而且我不认为你能从股市中赚钱。中产阶级从股市中赚钱。你像沃伦·巴菲特那样赚钱——你拥有一家你可以影响的公司的一部分，你可以帮助确保它成功。所以要做好研究，但这些通常是最好的类型：家人和朋友。我知道对很多人来说，家人和朋友可能很困难。很多人没有有钱的家人和朋友，我完全理解这一点，我会谈到其他方法。但我想先谈谈这一点，因为家人和朋友——这样做如此好的原因是因为他们了解你。你不需要向别人证明你的个性、你的形象、你的奉献精神。

You will look at it and say, "Well, I can't afford the best, so I'll get this person," which is fine. I understand that. But smart people think differently. Smart people think, "Who are the best?" Let's say I'm building a competitor to LinkedIn, HelpBank.com. So I think, "Who's number two at LinkedIn? I want them to come and join me." They're never going to be number one at LinkedIn, not for a long time, but maybe they want the chance to build their own LinkedIn and come join me. The great thing about the number two at LinkedIn is they definitely have some money in the bank, some money to invest in the business. I've done this many times, so this isn't just a theory. Look at your team members as potential investors in the platform. I'm running today Help.com. The people involved in this business have invested in this business. Callum, who's buying the camera right now, has put his own money into this business. He's got equity because of it, and he's taken a lower salary initially. So there are all sorts of benefits to actually doing it this way.

你会看着它说："我请不起最好的，那就请这个人吧。"这没问题，我能理解。但聪明人的想法不同。聪明人会想："谁是最优秀的？"假设我正在打造一个LinkedIn的竞争对手HelpBank.com。那么我会想："谁是LinkedIn的第二号人物？我想请他们来加入我。"他们在LinkedIn永远当不了一把手，短期内都不可能，但也许他们想要机会打造自己的LinkedIn，来加入我。LinkedIn二号人物的好处在于他们肯定有些积蓄，有些资金可以投资这个业务。我这样做过很多次，所以这不只是理论。把你的团队成员视为平台的潜在投资者。我现在运营Help.com。参与这个业务的人都投资了这个业务。正在购买摄像头的卡勒姆已经把自己的钱投入了这个业务。他因此获得了股权，而且最初接受了较低的薪水。所以实际这样做有各种好处。

There are all sorts of benefits to actually doing it this way. You can get your cost down, you can get the best in-class involved in the business, and you can bring money in to help make the company work. It's much better to have money from people that are actually working in the business than people externally who are asking you for a report of when they're going to get their money back. The third thing you can do, and of course this is more traditional but it is very complex, so I try to explain how to go about getting this type of person in your business, but it's an angel investor. Now you might have heard the term many times, you probably watched rubbish shows like Dragon's Den and thought that getting an investor is the dragon or the angel sits there with all the money and you are desperately trying to get that money off them by making them see your vision. That is the wrong way to get an angel investor. The best way to get an angel investor on board once you've identified them and done the research to find out who they are, you've been very clear about what you're going to give.

采用这种方式实际上有多种好处。你可以降低成本，让业内顶尖人才参与业务，并引入资金帮助公司运营。从实际参与业务的人那里获得资金远比从外部那些不断询问何时能收回投资回报的人那里获得资金要好得多。你可以做的第三件事当然是更传统但非常复杂的，所以我试图解释如何在业务中引入这类人，那就是天使投资人。你可能多次听说过这个术语，可能看过像《龙穴》这样的垃圾节目，认为获得投资就是那条龙或天使坐在那里拥有所有资金，而你拼命试图通过让他们看到你的愿景来获取资金。这是获取天使投资人的错误方式。一旦你确定了天使投资人并完成了调查了解他们是谁，最好的方式就是非常清楚地说明你将提供什么。

无

Of course you need to know how much you're going to give them and why, and I'll get into equity in a little bit later in the video so you could try to work that bit out. But once you've established who you want as an investor and what you're willing to give them, the way to get an investor is completely the opposite to what you think. You think getting an investor is "hi I've got a business, this is the business, would you like to invest?" No. The best way to get an angel investor is not ask for money. The best way to get an angel investor is ask for help, because you've identified the right investor. They want to feel value - if they can't bring value, they don't want to invest. And often if you do it right, it's not like Dragon's Den. I've invested in 78 businesses, I always feel honored and lucky when I get to invest in a successful business. They do not treat me like a dragon.

当然你需要知道要给他们多少股份以及原因，我稍后会在视频中详细讨论股权问题，这样你可以试着计算这部分内容。但一旦你确定了想要什么样的投资者以及愿意给他们什么，获得投资者的方式完全与你想象的相反。你以为获得投资者是说"你好，我有个业务，这是业务介绍，你想投资吗？"不对。获得天使投资人的最佳方式不是要钱，而是寻求帮助，因为你已经确定了合适的投资者。他们希望感受到价值——如果他们不能带来价值，他们就不想投资。而且如果你做得对，通常不会像《龙穴》那样。我已经投资了78家企业，当我能够投资一家成功的企业时，我总是感到荣幸和幸运。他们不会把我当作恶龙对待。

If they invest all of that, it's common sense, right? I don't need to teach you that. Right now, with awe, they treat me with respect, but they also identify why they've approached me, how I can bring value, and make me feel special. Ultimately, I then feel lucky to be involved in that business if they do that right. If you ask me for advice, you're more likely to get money out of me than if you straight up ask me for money. Now I'm not saying don't build ask into the process. Of course, when you approach an angel investor, you should definitely put in there that you're looking for money. But the best way to put it is we're looking for money from the right people. Make it a little harder for people to get involved in your business. That's how you get an angel investor. You create FOMO, right? FOMO, you probably heard it, but in case you haven't, it's probably one of the most powerful things: fear of missing out. You make people understand, and you do it sincerely, that if they don't invest, they're missing out. That is the key to getting an angel investor. Now, of course, treat an angel investor with respect.

如果他们投入全部资金，这是常识，对吧？我不需要教你这些。现在，他们怀着敬畏之心尊重我，同时也会说明为何找我合作、我能带来什么价值，并让我感到特别。如果他们做得好，最终我会觉得参与这项业务很幸运。如果你向我寻求建议，比起直接要钱，你更可能从我这里获得资金。我并不是说不要在流程中加入资金请求。当然，当你接触天使投资人时，必须明确表明你在寻求资金。但最好的表达方式是：我们正在寻找合适的投资人。让参与你业务的门槛稍高一些。这才是获得天使投资人的方法。你要制造FOMO（错失恐惧症），对吧？你可能听说过FOMO，但若没听过，这可能是最强大的心理之一：害怕错过。你要让人们真诚地意识到，如果不投资就会错失良机。这是获得天使投资人的关键。当然，要以尊重态度对待天使投资人。

If you can prepare a correct and appropriate amount of equity they're going to get, make it clear why. Explain your long-term investment plans and how they're going to dilute, because angel investors often get diluted. So if you're offering them 5%, it might sound like a lot, but if you get another investor and another investor as things go down the line, that person could end up with 1% of the company or half a percent of the company. Remember, most angel investors will be involved in the business, so make sure you actually need them to help you. Don't just pretend that they need you - you need them, because once you get them on board as an investor, it will go pear-shaped if not handled properly. It's not just about convincing the person to get on board, it's also convincing yourself that they're the right person to have with you on this journey in the long term. Make sure you do that.

如果你能准备正确且适量的股权分配，要明确说明原因。解释你的长期投资计划以及股权将如何稀释，因为天使投资人经常面临股权稀释。如果你给他们5%的股权，听起来可能很多，但随着后续引入其他投资人，他们最终可能只持有公司1%或0.5%的股权。记住，大多数天使投资人会参与公司业务，所以确保你确实需要他们的帮助。不要假装他们需要你——实际上是你需要他们，因为一旦他们作为投资人加入，如果处理不当就会出问题。这不仅仅是说服对方加入，也是说服自己他们是长期陪伴你走这段旅程的合适人选。确保你做到这一点。

Most VCs genuinely want a business that's proven and needs capital to scale. The way to get a VC on board: first, identify if they have money now. Many VCs are raising funds, deploying funds, and raising funds again. They won't necessarily tell you – they'll take meetings and understand your business but may not have funds. We joke in the VC world: "You're too tall for radio." You go for a radio station job interview, they reject you, and the reason given is "you were too short for radio." In other words, they don't tell you the real reason. You can find out if they're raising funds by Googling them. Don't waste time approaching VCs who are raising money – they won't deploy capital and will waste your time.

大多数风险投资机构真正想要的是已经得到验证且需要资金来扩张的业务。获得风投支持的方法：首先确认他们当前是否有资金。许多风投机构正处于募资、投资、再募资的循环中。他们不一定会明确告知——他们会安排会议了解你的业务，但可能并没有可投资金。风投圈有个玩笑话："你太高了不适合电台工作。"你去电台面试被拒，对方给出的理由却是"你太矮不适合电台"。换言之，他们不会告诉你真实原因。你可以通过谷歌搜索了解他们是否正在募资。不要浪费时间接触正在募资的风投——他们不会进行投资，只会浪费你的时间。

The other thing you can do, and I think it's very important, is see who they've invested in before. There's a good chance if they've invested in a similar business to yours, it's one of two things. It's either bad news or good news for you. If it's good, then they will invest in many different companies. For example, there was an investment company that invested in all the Uber-type businesses. They invested in Uber, they invested in Lyft, they invested in all of them. They hedged their bet that one of them was going to win. They want to be a part of all of them to make sure that they didn't lose. Other VCs will only invest in one company in that category, so just make sure you understand that. But if it's bad news and they only invest in one company in that category, then you can go to the competitor of that VC and create a rivalry between the VC firms. I've seen it play out many times. You make them feel like, "Well, they've invested in Uber, but I'm Lyft and I think we're going to beat Uber. Would you like to invest?"

另一件你可以做的事情，我认为非常重要，就是了解他们之前投资过哪些公司。如果他们投资过与你类似的企业，很可能出现两种情况：这对你来说要么是好消息，要么是坏消息。如果是好消息，那么他们会投资许多不同的公司。例如，曾有一家投资公司投资了所有类似优步的企业。他们投资了优步，投资了Lyft，投资了所有这些公司。他们通过分散投资来对冲风险，确保其中一家能够胜出。他们希望参与所有项目以确保不会错失机会。其他风险投资公司则只会在该类别中投资一家企业，所以你需要清楚理解这一点。但如果是坏消息，即他们只在该类别投资了一家公司，那么你可以去找这家风投的竞争对手，在风投公司之间制造竞争关系。我多次见证过这种情况。你可以让他们产生这样的想法："他们投资了优步，但我是Lyft，我认为我们将击败优步。您有兴趣投资吗？"

You make them feel like they've invested in Uber, but you're Lyft and you think you're going to beat Uber. Would you like to invest in us? It's primal but it works. Think about again: have they got money? Don't waste time selling to people that don't have money. See the investor's previous company investments, understand that, and then try to get connected to a previous company that VC has invested in. It's much more powerful for you to get introduced by one of the other portfolio companies of that VC than you personally approaching that VC. So try to make connections. It's also good due diligence, by the way. If you speak to the company that got investment from that VC, you can find out whether that VC was decent or not, because some of these VCs are awful. So you can do your due diligence at the same time, hopefully make a relationship with a founder that can introduce you to the VC when the time is right.

你让他们感觉像是投资了优步，但你是来福车并且你认为你会打败优步。你愿意投资我们吗？这很原始但确实有效。再想一想：他们有钱吗？不要浪费时间向没有钱的人推销。查看投资者之前的公司投资，理解这一点，然后尝试联系该风投曾投资过的公司。通过该风投投资组合中的其他公司介绍你，比你亲自接触该风投要有效得多。所以要尝试建立联系。顺便说一句，这也是很好的尽职调查。如果你与从该风投获得投资的公司交谈，你可以了解该风投是否体面，因为其中一些风投很糟糕。这样你可以在进行尽职调查的同时，希望与一位创始人建立关系，在适当时机将你介绍给该风投。

Now the fifth way again, I've never seen this way explained to people before and it's not traditional, but I have done it many many times. That is work with your brand partner or client to fund your growth. I had an office in Hong Kong and a client wanted us to open up in the Middle East. I was a bit reluctant, which is why I think I found out about this hack, because I originally said we don't want to open up there. I think they just wanted us to open up there and then service them, and they didn't want to spend any money doing it. But because we said no and they really wanted to work with us there, they offered to pay us to open up there. So this is a hack I learned and I will use it many many many more times after this. Sometimes your client who wants your service or the brand that's sponsoring you will pay for your expansion. Sometimes it's easier for them to do that than go out and build it sales for example, or work with a new partner that doesn't understand their philosophy. So your existing clients can be your investor and it can be really powerful if you do it right too, because that client then feels invested in your success.

现在说第五种方法，我从未见过有人向他人这样解释过这种方式，这并非传统做法，但我已经实践过很多很多次。那就是与你的品牌合作伙伴或客户合作，为你的发展提供资金。我在香港设有办事处，一位客户希望我们在中东开设分支机构。我当时有些犹豫，这大概就是我发现了这个诀窍的原因，因为我最初表示我们不想在那里开设业务。我认为他们只是希望我们在那里开设机构然后为他们服务，却不想为此投入任何资金。但由于我们拒绝了，而他们又非常希望在那里与我们合作，他们主动提出支付我们在那里开设业务的费用。这就是我学到的诀窍，之后我会多次运用这个方法。有时候，需要你服务的客户或赞助你的品牌会为你的扩张买单。有时候，对他们来说这样做比自己去建立销售渠道，或者与不理解他们理念的新合作伙伴合作更容易。因此，你现有的客户可以成为你的投资者，如果操作得当，这种方式会非常有效，因为客户会觉得你的成功与他们息息相关。

They're not going to make you go for a tender every year. They're not going to chop and change you as a client or partner or supplier because they want you to succeed, because they own equity in you. Now of course you have to do this carefully. For example, if one of your clients is a bank and they invest in you, it can get very messy suddenly on the legal side. Equally, if you are working with a particular provider - let's say in my case I work with lots of different online service providers but I partner with GoDaddy - but if GoDaddy invested in my business, it means all the other online suppliers probably wouldn't work with me, which would not help the people I'm trying to help, which is people starting businesses. So I think it's quite important to make sure you get the right client or the right brand to invest in you. But it can be huge money and brands do have investment divisions. Google Ventures - Google, it's ironic - they invest in businesses. They invested in a coffee shop called Blue Bottle, a coffee shop. So it's possible to get Google to invest in your business, but you have to understand again the motives go back to my sales point.

他们不会让你每年都去投标。他们不会把你当作客户、合作伙伴或供应商随意更换，因为他们希望你成功，因为他们拥有你的股权。当然，你必须谨慎处理这种情况。例如，如果你的某个客户是银行，而他们投资了你，法律层面可能会突然变得非常混乱。同样地，如果你与某个特定供应商合作——比如我的情况，我与许多不同的在线服务提供商合作，但与GoDaddy建立了合作伙伴关系——但如果GoDaddy投资了我的业务，意味着其他所有在线供应商可能都不会与我合作，这将无助于我想要帮助的人群，也就是创业的人们。因此，我认为确保找到合适的客户或合适的品牌来投资你非常重要。但这可能涉及巨额资金，而且品牌确实设有投资部门。Google Ventures——谷歌，这很讽刺——他们投资企业。他们投资了一家名为Blue Bottle的咖啡店，一家咖啡店。所以让谷歌投资你的业务是可能的，但你必须再次理解其动机，这又回到了我的销售观点。

Earlier in the video, I explained how to sell to these brands using that sales system again, but ultimately it's a way to raise money. Now there's one final method I want to quickly discuss with you to raise capital and make your business work. This relates to what I mentioned at the beginning of this video segment: ensure you actually need an investor. Sometimes when people approach me for funding, I ask what they need the money for. Most often, though not always, they want to increase sales, grow their product, or reach more customers. However, when I investigate further, they don't actually need my money - they just need a better sales system. Frequently when considering fundraising, you'll discover that by examining your business closely, you might realize you need money to purchase products. In such cases, you could use crowdfunding, for example, or find alternative methods to sell your product.

在视频的前面部分，我解释了如何再次使用那个销售系统向这些品牌销售产品，但这本质上是一种融资方式。现在我想与您快速讨论最后一种筹集资金并使业务运转的方法。这与我在此视频片段开头提到的内容相关：确保您确实需要投资者。有时当人们向我寻求资金时，我会询问他们资金的用途。大多数情况下（虽然并非总是如此），他们想要增加销售额、扩展产品或触达更多客户。但当我深入调查时，发现他们实际上并不需要我的资金——他们只是需要一个更好的销售系统。在考虑融资时，您经常会发现通过仔细审视业务，可能会意识到需要资金来购买产品。在这种情况下，您可以使用众筹等方式，或寻找销售产品的替代方法。

You can find methods of selling your product ahead of time through platforms like Indiegogo and platforms that will pre-sell your product to get you the revenue you need in advance. You're not giving away any equity when you do that. You can pre-sell your product on certain crowdfunding sites before it's made, and then you can use the money you got from that pre-order to go and make it. That is often a much better way than raising money from an investor. Of course, crowdfunding is quite big across the board now. You can raise money through crowdfunding, you can do equity crowdfunding, and there's plenty of sites that do that. I'll put some links down below in the video if you want to check out who they are. But ultimately, you want to figure out whether or not you really need the money from a customer pre-buying it, from an investor who's going to help bring value, or from a community that's going to support you in the future. You can do crowdfunding where you sell your product, you can do crowdfunding where you sell equity, you can do crowdfunding where ultimately it's just a loan.

你可以通过像Indiegogo这样的平台提前销售产品的方法，这些平台可以预售你的产品，让你提前获得所需收入。这样做时你无需放弃任何股权。你可以在某些众筹网站上产品尚未生产时就进行预售，然后使用预售获得的资金去生产产品。这通常比从投资者那里筹集资金要好得多。当然，如今众筹在各个领域都相当普遍。你可以通过众筹筹集资金，可以进行股权众筹，有很多网站提供这些服务。如果你想了解这些平台，我会在视频下方提供一些链接。但最终，你需要确定自己真正需要的资金是来自客户预购、能够带来价值的投资者，还是未来会支持你的社区。你可以进行产品销售类的众筹，可以进行股权销售的众筹，也可以进行最终只是贷款的众筹。

You can do crowdfunding where people will just support you, like GoFundMe. Crowdfunding is definitely one of the ways I think today you should leverage before going to the more traditional routes of say a VC or an angel, of course family and friends. So crowdfunding is powerful and don't overlook it. I'm going to put the links to all the different types of crowdfunding sites down below. Go check them out and let me know if you have any questions on this subject because it is a complicated one. I will do a video in the future about how to launch a proper crowdfunding site, but that's not now. How to get a sponsor? This is something I get asked all the time. I'm going to give you the code, I'm going to give you the cheat code I guess on how to do it. And I want to first of all say if any sponsors are listening to this, I have applied this technique on you so forgive me. The first is understanding why sponsorship deals happen.

你可以进行众筹，人们会直接支持你，比如GoFundMe。众筹绝对是当今你应该利用的方式之一，在转向更传统的途径如风险投资或天使投资之前，当然还有家人和朋友。所以众筹很强大，不要忽视它。我会把所有不同类型的众筹网站链接放在下面。去查看一下，如果你对这个主题有任何问题请告诉我，因为它很复杂。我将来会制作一个关于如何启动一个合适的众筹网站的视频，但不是现在。如何获得赞助？这是我经常被问到的问题。我要给你密码，我想我要给你如何做到的作弊代码。首先我想说，如果有任何赞助商正在听这个，我已经对你们应用了这种技巧，所以请原谅我。首先是理解赞助交易为什么会发生。

We can get into what sponsorship deals structures are, and that's quite complex in itself. But I want to give you the tool today to get a sponsor on board. The way to understand a sponsor, there are two things that make a sponsor come on board. One is value return. What they invest in sponsoring you, they get back in some form, be that in views or be that in sales. They get value back, ideally trackable value. So billboard companies, which I think are a joke in what they value-wise give back to a brand, sell because they show how many people walk past that billboard, how many people are looking at that billboard each day. And brands love that stuff, so proper ROI on their investment. The second way, and this one's a bit more tricky but very powerful if you get it right, is the emotional sale. You see this quite a lot in local football clubs in England. Big brands sometimes are sponsoring small local football clubs because the CEO plays football there or the CEO grew up there playing football. Basically, the emotional sale. Now I have used both of these to get deals, and both of them can actually work together. They're not mutually exclusive.

我们可以深入探讨赞助交易结构的具体内容，这本身相当复杂。但今天我想为您提供获得赞助商的实用方法。理解赞助商动机的关键在于两点：首先是价值回报。他们投资赞助您，会以某种形式获得回报，无论是观看量还是销售额。他们期望获得可追踪的价值回报。比如那些在我看来毫无价值的广告牌公司，他们向品牌方推销的理由是能够展示每天有多少人经过广告牌、多少人注视广告牌。品牌方青睐这种可量化的投资回报。第二种方式更为微妙但效果显著，即情感销售。在英国地方足球俱乐部中常见这种现象，大品牌有时会赞助小型地方俱乐部，因为公司CEO在那里踢球或成长于该地。本质上这就是情感销售。我曾运用这两种方式达成交易，它们实际上可以协同作用，并非相互排斥。

Frankly, sometimes the emotional sale with the value return is probably the Holy Grail. If you can make it personal for the brand and the people running the brand, don't overlook them. If you're going to make it emotional for the person who runs the brand alongside bringing proper value, most of the time you can get a brand deal. Now where people fall over is not structuring value for a sponsor, and this is probably the third thing I highlight that's important to get a sponsorship deal: you've not understood the brand. Now I have made this mistake many times. I launched a business called coaster ads and it was brilliant marketing. I took all the bars in Hong Kong and I put ads on coasters. I took out the Carlsberg coasters and the Heineken coasters and I put in coasters with ads on them. And it was brilliant because you put your drink down on that coaster, you up and down look at it for an hour at least as you're putting the drink on it and picking up. It was brilliant retention, brilliant engagement, people saw the ads every time they're brilliant.

坦白说，有时情感销售与价值回报的结合可能是终极目标。如果你能让品牌和运营品牌的人感受到个性化，就不要忽视他们。如果你能在为品牌运营者带来情感共鸣的同时提供适当价值，大多数情况下你都能达成品牌合作。人们失败的地方往往在于未能为赞助商构建价值结构，这大概是我强调的第三点重要事项：你还没有真正理解品牌。我曾多次犯过这个错误。我创办了一个名为杯垫广告的业务，这是个绝妙的营销创意。我拿下香港所有酒吧，在杯垫上投放广告。我替换掉嘉士伯和喜力的杯垫，换上带有广告的杯垫。这个创意非常出色，因为当你把饮料放在杯垫上，在拿起放下饮料的至少一小时内，你会反复看到广告。这创造了绝佳的留存率和参与度，人们每次看到这些广告都会印象深刻。

But I tried to sell that service, that coaster ad service, to a jewelry business, and of course they laughed at me. In fact, I lost them as a client on the agency side because they thought I didn't understand their brand. I was so sure that that jewelry brand would get traction, which they would have done, but I didn't remember what their brand philosophy was. They're high-end, they're fashionable, they don't want a beer sat on top of them. I made a mistake. I didn't understand the brand, and this is where you need to get really, really clear what is the brand value. And so in that case, in the jewelry case, they want to sponsor, you know, 007 movies with James Bond's girlfriend wearing the jewelry and looking sexy. You know, they want to be involved in things that are not linked to beer, that are not linked to somebody drunk putting their beer down on their brand. Now, I did eventually sell coaster ads out to airlines that wanted to promote going from Hong Kong to Singapore and so on and so forth, so I eventually did really well with that brand, but initially I learned an important

我曾试图向一家珠宝公司推销杯垫广告服务，结果他们当然嘲笑我。事实上，我因此失去了这个代理客户，因为他们认为我不理解他们的品牌定位。我当时坚信那个珠宝品牌会因此获得关注——这本可实现——但我忽略了他们的品牌理念。他们定位高端、追求时尚，绝不愿与啤酒杯垫为伍。我犯了错，未能真正理解品牌内涵，这正是需要彻底明确品牌价值的关键所在。就珠宝品牌而言，他们希望赞助的是007系列电影，让邦女郎佩戴珠宝尽显性感魅力。他们追求的是与啤酒无关、与醉汉随意放置酒瓶的行为划清界限的高端关联。后来我成功将杯垫广告卖给航空公司，用于推广香港至新加坡等航线，最终这个品牌业务发展得很好，但最初我吸取了一个重要

but initially I learned an important lesson: understand the brand, understand what their values are, understand how they traditionally advertise. For example, Visa advertises at the Olympics. They not only sponsor the Olympics, but they also spend a lot of money promoting the fact that they're at the Olympics. Too many people go to Visa and ask for sponsorship without understanding that probably the biggest activation that Visa ever does is the Olympics. So you're better off going and selling some value linked to the Olympics as opposed to saying please sponsor my event, because they're saying we sponsored the Olympics, we sponsored the biggest event in the world. Now you want us to sponsor your event? Brand values and understanding what that brand wants is key. But I mentioned it briefly a second ago, I want to highlight it is important: don't forget the people in these brands. Research who they are, understand what their motives are. Some of the brands that sponsor me today, GoDaddy and Tai banking, the people that run those brands care as much about entrepreneurs as the brands themselves. So when they see that me and my team are helping people, genuinely helping people have a better life.

但最初我学到了重要一课：了解品牌，理解其价值观，明白他们传统的广告方式。以Visa为例，Visa在奥运会做广告。他们不仅赞助奥运会，还投入大量资金宣传他们参与奥运会的事实。太多人去找Visa寻求赞助，却不明白Visa最大的营销活动可能就是奥运会。所以你最好去推销一些与奥运会相关的价值，而不是直接请求赞助你的活动，因为他们会说我们赞助了奥运会，我们赞助了世界上最大的活动。现在你要我们赞助你的活动？品牌价值观和了解品牌需求是关键。但我刚才简单提到过，我想强调这一点很重要：不要忘记这些品牌中的人。研究他们是谁，理解他们的动机。今天赞助我的一些品牌，如GoDaddy和泰银银行，运营这些品牌的人对创业者的关心程度不亚于品牌本身。所以当他们看到我和我的团队在帮助人们，真正帮助人们过上更好的生活时。

People have a better life, not only do the people buy into becoming a sponsor for us, the brand alignment is there and it happens right now. This does tie into the emotional sell somewhat, because for example, one of the people I work with, GoDaddy, had a small business. She knew how hard it was to make that business work, so when she sees what we're doing alongside what GoDaddy does—this isn't a sponsored video by the way, but I'm just highlighting the example so you learn—ultimately these people make a difference in that brand. That brand is made up of people, so as long as those people don't get fired for sponsoring something that has no relevance to their brand, you can actually end up having champions inside these companies for you to help you get the sponsorship. I've had that many, many times. Now, the fifth way to get a brand to sponsor you that no one talks about—I don't know why, maybe it's some sort of industry dirty secret—but it's a very, very powerful way of getting a brand sponsor on board is work with someone that's already working with one of these brands.

人们能过上更好的生活，不仅大家愿意成为我们的赞助商，品牌契合度也自然达成，而且立竿见影。这确实与情感营销有所关联，比如与我合作过的GoDaddy公司有位员工曾经营小生意。她深知创业维艰，所以当她看到我们的工作与GoDaddy的业务相辅相成——顺便说明这不是赞助视频，我只是举例供大家学习——最终这些人在品牌内部产生了积极影响。品牌是由人组成的，只要这些人不会因为赞助与品牌无关的内容而被解雇，你实际上就能在这些公司内部培养支持者，协助你获得赞助。我已有过很多次这样的经历。接下来是第五个获取品牌赞助的方法，这个方法无人提及——不知为何，也许是行业潜规则——但这是个极其有效的让品牌赞助商加入的方法：与已经和这些品牌合作的人建立合作。

An agent is often one way to describe it, but there are two types of typical agents that brands work with. There is a media buying company, which is a company that will go out and buy all the ad space for that brand. They're paid by the brand to go and get the best deals possible and buy up ad space. You can talk to these media buyers, and often it can be better to talk to them than go direct to the brand because the brand is too busy with its day-to-day to deal with you as a media owner. They would prefer to deal with the media buyer, one contact, and then that media buyer will deal with everybody that wants to sell media. So recently someone came to me and said they've got a fleet of vans and they want to get brands to advertise on their vans. They tried going direct to brands, and the brand said no, gave them a contact of a media buyer. The media buyer said great, and they bought all the event. It's much quicker. The media buyer has a relationship with the brands and often they hold the money.

代理人通常是一种描述方式，但品牌通常与两类典型代理人合作。其中一种是媒体购买公司，这类公司会外出为品牌购买所有广告位。品牌支付费用让他们去寻找最优惠的交易并收购广告空间。你可以与这些媒体购买者沟通，通常与他们交谈比直接联系品牌更好，因为品牌忙于日常事务，无暇顾及作为媒体所有者的你。品牌更愿意与媒体购买者打交道，只需一个联系人，然后该媒体购买者会处理所有想要销售媒体的对象。最近有人来找我，说他们拥有一支货车车队，希望让品牌在他们的货车上做广告。他们尝试直接联系品牌，但品牌拒绝了，并给了他们一个媒体购买者的联系方式。媒体购买者表示很好，然后他们完成了整个活动的购买。这种方式快得多。媒体购买者与品牌有关系，而且通常他们掌握着资金。

The media buyer has a relationship with the brands and often they hold the money. The brands already allocated the money to the media buyer, so stop trying to sell to the brand, sell to the media buyer. The other way to do it is via the agencies. I used to own an agency, which is one of the reasons I know this subject so well. A brand will have a company that will come up with a campaign idea for them. Often when you're coming up with a campaign for a brand, you're also looking at how the campaign will be applied in the real world. It might go on taxis, it might go on a bus, it might go on a coaster. You can actually tap into these agencies. Examples without showing any preference include agencies like MC Sari, Ogie, Leo Berett. These agencies already have the relationship with the company, and if you get in there with your idea or your product, they can often insert it or even come up with a campaign to sell it into the brand for you. I personally prefer to deal with brands direct many times, but do not neglect media buyers are your friends and agencies can be.

媒体购买者与品牌方有关系，通常他们掌握着资金。品牌方已将资金分配给媒体购买者，所以不要再试图向品牌方销售，要向媒体购买者销售。另一种方式是通过代理机构。我曾经拥有一家代理机构，这也是我如此了解这个主题的原因之一。品牌方会有一家公司为他们策划广告活动。通常当你为品牌策划广告活动时，你还需要考虑广告活动在现实世界中的应用方式。它可能会出现在出租车、公交车或杯垫上。你实际上可以利用这些代理机构。不偏袒任何一方的例子包括像MC Sari、Ogie、Leo Berett这样的代理机构。这些代理机构已经与公司建立了关系，如果你带着你的想法或产品进入其中，他们通常可以将其插入，甚至策划一个广告活动来帮你向品牌方销售。我个人很多时候更倾向于直接与品牌方打交道，但不要忽视媒体购买者是你的朋友，代理机构也可以是。

and agencies can be your friends and it can be a much quicker sale to get them on board as a sponsor. One of the best hacks to get a brand as a sponsor is to be personally really vested in that brand. For example, we recently put a doorbell at the bottom of our staircase that people could press to pitch their dream and we would help them. We decided the best product for us to do that, the most economical product that worked on the internet, was Ring doorbell owned by Amazon. We didn't ask Ring to sponsor us, we didn't ask Amazon to sponsor us. It was just the best product we believed in, and it suited what we were trying to do. So we installed it and we marketed it, and of course guess who saw it - Ring and Amazon. So now who are we working with? Amazon. What I'm talking about here is just using the brand in your life and therefore it being a natural fit for the brand to work with you.

代理商可以成为你的朋友，让他们作为赞助商加入可以更快达成交易。获得品牌赞助的最佳技巧之一就是个人真正信赖该品牌。例如，我们最近在楼梯底部安装了一个门铃，人们可以按门铃推销他们的梦想，我们会帮助他们。我们决定最适合我们做这件事的产品，在互联网上最经济实惠的产品，就是亚马逊旗下的Ring门铃。我们没有要求Ring赞助我们，也没有要求亚马逊赞助我们。这只是我们相信的最佳产品，并且符合我们想要实现的目标。所以我们安装了它并进行营销，当然你猜谁看到了——Ring和亚马逊。那么现在我们与谁合作？亚马逊。我在这里谈论的只是在生活中使用该品牌，因此品牌与您合作是自然而然的事情。

When I wear Whoop out on the street, it's natural because I like the product. Whoop will see me with millions of views on my videos wearing their product and they will contact me. I think that leaning into a brand relationship and not initially thinking about the money relates to some points I was making earlier about delayed gratification in sponsorship, which can also be very powerful. Working with brands that you love will always be easier than forcing a brand into your ecosystem. Doing activities with that brand as part of your day-to-day business life can lead to sponsorship.

当我在街上佩戴Whoop时，这很自然因为我喜欢这个产品。Whoop会看到我在视频中佩戴他们的产品获得数百万次观看，然后他们会联系我。我认为专注于建立品牌关系而非最初就考虑金钱回报，与我之前提到的赞助中延迟满足的观点相关，这种方式也可能非常有效。与你喜爱的品牌合作总是比强行将某个品牌纳入你的生态系统更容易。将品牌活动融入日常商业生活也可能促成赞助合作。

You can take away the logo, you can take away everything, and you still know it's that brand. It's not about the actual logo design. Branding is about the purpose of the business, the essence of what you're doing. Nike is about supporting athletes. Apple is about supporting creativity. Ultimately, when you're coming to figure out your own brand, I would start with your personal brand because it's a really good way of figuring out how to build a brand. If you're honest about yourself, you can make a brand persona. You start with writing down your values: what do you care about, what are your non-negotiables, what would you say no to, what would you say yes to. Understanding your personality, understanding what it is you want to do - that's what your brand is about, that's who you are. Now you will already have a personal brand. Anyone that doesn't want a personal brand, I'm sorry, you're going to have one no matter what. People will talk about you when you're not in the room. You need to embrace personal branding, and by understanding how others perceive you, it can literally change the trajectory of your

你可以去掉标志，你可以去掉一切，但你仍然知道那是那个品牌。这不仅仅是关于实际标志设计的问题。品牌建设关乎企业的宗旨，关乎你所做事情的本质。耐克关乎支持运动员，苹果关乎支持创造力。最终，当你要建立自己的品牌时，我会建议从个人品牌开始，因为这是学习如何建立品牌的绝佳方式。如果你对自己诚实，就能打造品牌形象。从写下你的价值观开始：你在乎什么，你的底线是什么，你会拒绝什么，你会接受什么。了解自己的个性，理解你想要做什么——这就是你品牌的核心，这就是你的本质。现在你已经有了个人品牌。任何不想要个人品牌的人，很抱歉，无论如何你都会有一个。人们会在你不在场时谈论你。你需要拥抱个人品牌建设，通过理解他人对你的看法，这确实能够改变你的发展轨迹

It can literally change the trajectory of your life. Now I have some real gripes with personal brand, and it's not very scalable. Only in certain exceptions around people like Kardashians and so on can you actually scale a personal brand. As someone that's built a personal brand, as someone that's got 4 million followers that spent four years building a personal brand here in the UK, I can tell you it is sometimes a pain in the ass. I am responsible now no matter what to do videos like this and post up stuff even when I'm tired like now. I'm actually tired and I still have to do this video because if I don't do it, it probably won't be taken seriously. I could give this knowledge to my colleague and give it to you, and you probably wouldn't listen. So you need to hear it from someone that's been there and done it like me, and I understand that and I actually do love doing these videos and helping you. But I'm just trying to highlight the personal brand side is dangerous if that's all you build. You have to take personal brand seriously. You have to identify what your personal brand is.

这确实能改变你的人生轨迹。现在我对个人品牌有些不满，它的可扩展性并不强。只有在像卡戴珊家族这样的特殊案例中，你才能真正扩展个人品牌。作为一个在英国花了四年时间建立个人品牌、拥有400万粉丝的人，我可以告诉你这有时真的很烦人。我现在有责任无论如何都要制作这样的视频并发布内容，即使像现在这样疲惫。我其实很累，但仍然必须制作这个视频，因为如果我不做，可能就不会被认真对待。我可以把这些知识交给我的同事并传授给你，但你可能不会听。所以你需要听我这样亲身经历过的人讲述，我理解这一点，而且我确实喜欢制作这些视频并帮助你们。但我只是想强调，如果只建立个人品牌是很危险的。你必须认真对待个人品牌。你必须明确你的个人品牌是什么。

and by the way I know people that have made their personal brand not being on social media their personal brand is they don't get back to you in email that's actually sometimes what makes them unique that's their personal brand I don't reply to DMs I want to make videos like this that bring you value I want to do lives that means I interact in a real world with real people I have my rules I have my values I'm dyslexic so I don't like reading DMS but having those rules and having that discipline will ultimately help you define what people say about you instead of people saying it without you having defined it but brand values of your own can teach you how you need to do exactly the same for your company name.

顺便说一句，我认识一些人通过不在社交媒体上建立个人品牌——他们的个人品牌就是不回复电子邮件，这实际上有时正是他们的独特之处。那就是他们的个人品牌：我不回复私信。我想制作像这样能为你带来价值的视频，我想进行直播，这意味着我在现实世界中与真实的人互动。我有自己的规则和价值观，我有阅读障碍所以不喜欢读私信。但拥有这些规则和纪律最终会帮助你定义人们对你的评价，而不是在未经你定义的情况下被人评说。你自己的品牌价值观可以教你如何为你的公司名称做同样的事情。

So let's take my brand Help Bank right. Help Bank has a lot of the traits that I personally value: honesty, openness, authenticity. These are all words in my personal brand persona that have translated into my company persona. However, Help Bank's long-term future also involves helping people with finance. Finance is not a word I use on my personal brand. And also supporting people to get the funding they need is something I have personally done many, many times. But as an organization, as a platform, it's going to be a much more serious thing for Help Bank. So when the branding was designed, we said it has to look a little bit more serious than the Simon Squid brand because ultimately we'll be funding people's dreams at scale and people need to trust if we tell them we're going to fund their dreams, it's actually going to happen. So the Help Bank branding is a combination of the Simon Squid branding and our competitors potentially in the future. We want to make it look serious, it has some element of fun, but ultimately it has its own brand persona. And all you need to do initially to get the brand right is write down all the different brand values. Now I want to teach you about how companies apply brand at scale and there's a few different ways it generally plays out. So let's take a brand like Canon and Canon run a brand method which we call reference right and reference is when they leverage someone else's brand to

以我的品牌Help Bank为例。Help Bank具备许多我个人重视的特质：诚实、开放、真实。这些都是我个人品牌形象中的关键词，现已融入公司形象。然而Help Bank的长期发展还涉及帮助人们处理财务问题。"财务"这个词并不出现在我的个人品牌中。协助人们获得所需资金是我个人多次实践过的事情。但作为一个组织、一个平台，这对Help Bank而言将是更为严肃的事务。因此在设计品牌形象时，我们提出它必须比Simon Squid品牌显得更庄重，因为最终我们将大规模资助人们的梦想，当承诺资助梦想时，人们需要确信我们言出必行。Help Bank的品牌形象融合了Simon Squid品牌元素以及未来潜在竞争对手的特质。我们希望在保持严肃基调的同时融入趣味元素，但最终形成独特的品牌形象。最初要确立正确品牌，只需列出所有不同的品牌价值。现在我将讲解企业如何规模化应用品牌，通常有几种不同实施方式。以佳能为例，他们采用我们称之为"参照权"的品牌方法，即借助其他品牌的

Reference is when they leverage someone else's brand to make their brand look good. For example, Canon works with a photographer called Peter McKinnon who is a brilliant photographer. I'm a big fan of his, and by sponsoring him and supporting him, they don't need that person as a CEO in their company like Apple has done. They have it external. Nike also does this. I mentioned earlier Nike will sponsor top performing athletes with nice personalities that have values, and that therefore becomes part of the Nike brand. So they use this reference model to make their own brand look good.

Now Apple, as I mentioned earlier, they use a different method. I call this the leadership method. The leadership method is basically where you have a person in the company that represents the brand values. Now in Help Bank I am that person. Probably in your business, if you're a small business owner, you are the person that is the leadership value brand ambassador for your company. You're probably the one that is asked to go on stage and talk about your business. You're the one in sales meetings. Whatever your business model is, you're probably the one representing the brand.

Of course, your staff will represent the brand. Your office environment will represent the brand. Like I said earlier, the days when you go out, have a party, and post on your social media will represent your brand. But when it comes to making your brand values clear, you do it by these two methods: you either have a reference model, which means you sponsor certain people that represent your brand value, or you have a leadership model, which is you personally in the company leading the charge to make sure people understand your brand. I think when it comes to brand building, there are some risks in both of these models. Now in the reference model, if a celebrity that's supporting your brand does something bad, that can affect your brand. This happens a lot, and they often get fired quickly. I think one of the most famous cases is Kanye West, who of course got dropped by Adidas and then lawsuits galore. But what I'm saying is, though, what's good about the reference model is you don't have to spend four years building up social media presence like me.

当然，你的员工会代表品牌。你的办公环境会代表品牌。正如我之前所说，当你外出聚会并在社交媒体上发布内容时，这些时刻都会代表你的品牌。但在明确品牌价值观方面，你可以通过两种方法实现：要么采用参考模式，即赞助某些能代表你品牌价值的人；要么采用领导模式，即由你本人亲自在公司带头确保人们理解你的品牌。我认为在品牌建设方面，这两种模式都存在一定风险。在参考模式中，如果支持你品牌的明星行为不端，就可能会影响你的品牌。这种情况经常发生，他们通常会被迅速解约。我认为最著名的案例之一就是坎耶·韦斯特，他当然被阿迪达斯解约，随后诉讼纷至沓来。但我想说的是，参考模式的好处在于你不必像我这样花费四年时间建立社交媒体影响力。

I've spent every single day for four years doing posts, building up a community. You can just leverage all of that hard work, and your brand can have the halo effect of working with me. But the downside is, what if I do something bad? Then your brand is at risk. So you need to have mechanisms in place to make sure you're protected as a brand. But that's how you scale brand. And of course, the Leadership Model also has its weaknesses. We all saw this a little bit with Steve Jobs. When Steve Jobs left Apple, Apple had a real problem for a long time. They put so much of their brand value in the Steve Jobs brand that when he left, the magic left, was often what people said. So you have to make sure that you as a leader, it's sustainable for you to be that leader and lead that brand effort, and/or there's a good transition model in place. And again, when Steve Jobs went back to Apple, he did have a strong transition model with Tim Cook. Now Tim Cook's an interesting one because he's not Steve Jobs of course, but he is Mr. Data. He's someone you trust with your

我花了整整四年时间每天发布内容，建立社区。你可以直接利用所有这些努力，你的品牌也能获得与我合作的光环效应。但缺点是，如果我做了不好的事情怎么办？那么你的品牌就会面临风险。所以你需要建立机制来确保作为品牌受到保护。但这就是扩大品牌规模的方式。当然，领导力模式也有其弱点。我们在史蒂夫·乔布斯身上都看到过一点。当史蒂夫·乔布斯离开苹果时，苹果在很长一段时间里遇到了真正的问题。他们把太多的品牌价值寄托在史蒂夫·乔布斯品牌上，以至于当他离开时，魔力就消失了，人们经常这么说。所以你必须确保作为领导者，你能够持续担任这个领导角色并领导品牌建设工作，或者需要有一个良好的过渡模式。再次，当史蒂夫·乔布斯回到苹果时，他确实与蒂姆·库克建立了强大的过渡模式。现在蒂姆·库克是个有趣的人物，因为他当然不是史蒂夫·乔布斯，但他是数据先生。他是你可以托付你的

He's someone you trust with your data, right? They've picked him in part because he looks trustworthy. He talks in a very trustworthy and transparent way. In Apple's process of building a brand today, that is more important to them than a maverick leader telling you about a brilliant product. In fact, the Apple iPhone hasn't changed much since Steve Jobs died. But the point I'm trying to make here is if you want a brand to be successful, you've got to pick one of these two strategies. Now you can do both of course, but you probably double the risk of having some problem in your business. Whichever path you choose, make sure you think it through right to the end. Have the ability to cut that influencer out of your business if anything goes wrong. And equally if you're running the Leadership Model, make sure that leader has a transition plan because at some point we're all going to die. Now hopefully we're all going to live forever with Elon's help, I'm sure that's true. But I will tell you now the final thing really important in brand: learn to say no.

他是你愿意托付数据的人，对吧？他们选择他部分原因在于他看起来值得信赖。他说话的方式非常可靠且透明。在苹果如今打造品牌的过程中，这对他们而言比一个特立独行的领导者向你介绍卓越产品更为重要。事实上，自史蒂夫·乔布斯去世后，苹果iPhone并没有太大变化。但我想说明的观点是，若想让品牌成功，你必须从这两种策略中择一而行。当然你可以两者兼顾，但这可能会让你业务出问题的风险加倍。无论选择哪条道路，都要确保彻底考虑周全。如果出现问题，要有能力将那位影响者从你的业务中剔除。同样地，如果采用领导力模式，务必确保那位领导者有交接计划，因为终有一天我们都会离开人世。当然希望在埃隆的帮助下我们能永生不死，我确信这是真的。但现在我要告诉你品牌建设中最后一件至关重要的事：学会拒绝。

If you don't say no to the wrong relationships, the wrong brand partnerships, the wrong clients, your brand will get damaged. I have had this experience myself. I spent 10 years building up a brand that had a fantastic reputation, and then I got a bad client that didn't understand how the world worked and damaged my brand with their big mouth and their lies. This can be hugely damaging. We all have probably heard the saying: you can spend 30 years building a reputation, and it only takes 5 seconds for it to go away. I tell you from experience that saying no to things is powerful. If you have an inkling, spider senses that someone isn't good or a brand isn't good, doesn't match with your morals, do not take their money. Say no. Your brand is the most valuable asset you will ever build. My company got sold for a lot of money in the end because I had a good brand image and good brand value. They told me they bought the brand, not the business. Build a brand, not a business, and I promise you that brand will live forever.

如果你不对错误的关系、错误的品牌合作、错误的客户说不，你的品牌就会受损。我自己就有过这样的经历。我花了10年时间建立了一个声誉极佳的品牌，然后遇到了一个不了解世界运作方式的糟糕客户，他们用大嘴巴和谎言损害了我的品牌。这可能造成巨大的损害。我们可能都听过这句话：你可以用30年建立声誉，但只需要5秒钟就能让它消失。我凭经验告诉你，对事物说不是非常有力的。如果你有预感，直觉告诉你某人不好或某个品牌不好，与你的道德观不符，不要拿他们的钱。说不。你的品牌是你将建立的最有价值的资产。我的公司最终以高价出售，因为我拥有良好的品牌形象和品牌价值。他们告诉我他们买的是品牌，而不是业务。建立品牌，而不是业务，我向你保证那个品牌将永存。

Next up: how to hire, how to grow, and how to build. These three things are intertwined, and if you get this formula right, your business can take off and forever give you the income you need, be a brand you love, and ultimately not be a management nightmare that a lot of people have when they build a business. So first of all, how to hire? I always tell people: if your business has a purpose and the people you hire believe in that purpose, you will never have to manage anybody. You will be managing purpose, not people. One of the big things people complain to me about is managing people, and often when I look at their business to see why, it's because they have not installed a purpose in their business that resonates with the people they have hired. Sometimes some businesses later install a purpose, but then that purpose just becomes a slogan on the wall because the people they hired in the early days weren't hired around purpose. You have to have this at the center of it all, and when you hire someone, always check that they genuinely care about that purpose. Some people will play you lip service to get the job.

接下来是如何招聘、如何发展和如何建设。这三者相互关联，如果你能掌握这个公式，你的企业就能腾飞，持续为你提供所需收入，成为你热爱的品牌，最终避免许多人在创业时遇到的管理噩梦。首先谈谈招聘。我常告诉人们：如果你的企业有明确的使命，而你招聘的员工都认同这个使命，那么你永远不需要管理任何人。你管理的将是使命，而非人员。很多人向我抱怨管理员工的问题，当我审视他们的企业时，往往发现这是因为他们没有在企业中植入能引起员工共鸣的使命。有时企业后来设立了使命，但这个使命最终只是墙上的标语，因为早期招聘的员工并非基于使命而聘用。你必须将使命置于核心位置，在招聘时务必确认应聘者真正关心这个使命。有些人会为了得到工作而对你虚与委蛇。

Some people will play you lip service to get the job, so there are a few hacks that you can do to make sure that person really cares. First of all, go check out their social media. Go see what that person really cares about. You will see it if they care about the planet. If you see them driving around in some gas-guzzling car, they probably don't care about the environment. So actually doing your research on your hires, being careful about the people you bring into your purpose matters. Check their history, check for references. I don't know why people don't do this. People don't ask for references anymore, I don't know why. Now I know in England it's illegal to give someone a bad reference, but if you ask right, I don't want people to have a bad employee in their life. If I had that bad employee in mine, it's important that we share these things to help that employee get better. If they had a bad reference, they'd act better, they'd do a better job. Now ultimately, I think when hiring people the key is give them Equity. Now I'm going to talk more about Equity a little bit later in the video.

有些人会对你花言巧语以获得工作，因此你可以采取一些技巧来确保这个人真正在意。首先，去查看他们的社交媒体。去看看这个人真正关心什么。如果他们关心地球，你会看到的。如果你看到他们开着高油耗的汽车到处跑，他们可能并不关心环境。所以实际上，对你的招聘对象进行研究，谨慎选择那些与你目标相符的人很重要。检查他们的历史，核实推荐信。我不知道为什么人们不这样做。人们不再要求提供推荐信了，我不知道为什么。现在我知道在英国，给某人写负面推荐信是违法的，但如果你问得恰当，我不希望别人生活中遇到糟糕的员工。如果我遇到过那个糟糕的员工，分享这些信息帮助那个员工改进是很重要的。如果他们有一封负面推荐信，他们会表现得更好，工作会更出色。最终，我认为招聘人员的关键是给予他们股权。我将在视频稍后部分更详细地讨论股权问题。

It always comes up, but if you give your team equity, they are aligned with your success. Now any owner of any business knows that the real value in a company is not its turnover, it's in its brand. If over 10 years an employee helps make that brand grow but are only taking an income, they're never getting their true value. You have to own equity in the business that you are working in. Now there's many different ways to do it. If you're working for someone today, of course you can go ask for equity in that company. You've got nothing to lose. They'll probably laugh, they might say no, I promise you respect you more especially if they're a Founder. The second thing is you can build a business where you work with that company but you own equity in it. So you can start your own company but have equity in that company and then work for that person. Now the point I'm telling you here is that give your employees respect. If you want to keep people and you want them to be motivated, have this conversation openly, talk about this subject.

这个问题经常被提及，但如果你给予团队股权，他们就会与你的成功保持一致。任何企业的所有者都知道，公司的真正价值不在于营业额，而在于品牌。如果一名员工在10年间帮助品牌成长却只领取工资，他们永远无法获得真正的价值。你必须在所工作的企业中拥有股权。实现这一目标有多种方式。如果你现在为他人工作，当然可以要求获得该公司的股权。你没有什么可失去的。他们可能会笑，可能会拒绝，但我保证他们会更尊重你，特别是如果对方是创始人。第二种方式是你可以创建一家与该公司合作但拥有股权的企业。这样你可以创办自己的公司，同时持有该公司的股权，然后为其工作。我想强调的是要尊重你的员工。如果你想留住人才并激励他们，就要开诚布公地进行对话，讨论这个话题。

You should be saying they should have equity now. It might not be possible to give people equity straight away. It might not be something you feel comfortable with doing straight away. But I promise you, your turnover will be less, your stress will be less, your company will be stronger if that person in your company has equity. Most people don't have the guts to do it, and then they spend years stressing they can't find anyone or that they can't find anyone that actually cares. It's because they don't own what you own. Give them a piece of the business and you'll have loyalty. Of course it comes with its risks, but in my opinion, high turnover, high management, high stress is a bigger risk than any equity problem you could have if someone leaves, for example. Ironically, most of the time, why would people leave if they have equity? In fact, I had a case recently: someone who worked with me for four years, I gave them equity in the business and then they left. But because I treated them with respect and because I treated them well and we had a good relationship when they left.

你现在就应该说他们应该拥有股权。可能无法立即给予人们股权。这可能不是你觉得能立即安心去做的事情。但我向你保证，如果公司里的人拥有股权，你的员工流动率会降低，你的压力会减轻，你的公司会更强大。大多数人没有勇气这样做，然后他们多年来一直苦恼找不到合适的人，或者找不到真正关心公司的人。这是因为他们不拥有你所拥有的东西。给他们一部分业务，你就会获得忠诚。当然这伴随着风险，但在我看来，高流动率、高管理成本、高压力是比任何股权问题都更大的风险，比如有人离职的情况。讽刺的是，大多数时候，如果人们拥有股权，他们为什么要离开呢？事实上，我最近有个案例：有人与我共事四年，我给了他们公司股权，然后他们离开了。但因为我尊重他们，因为我善待他们，当他们离开时我们保持着良好的关系。

They let me buy that equity back at a very low rate. They were very reasonable. They did not hold me for blackmail. Now, of course, if you've hired the right person under purpose and you've given them equity, most good people will not hold you over it to get that equity back. You can be reasonable. But if you've done the right thing in the beginning by giving people equity, it's so easy. Now the third thing I'll tell you, and this really links to how you grow your business: you can't grow a business without people. I would say that today with AI and all this technology, you'll be able to grow a business with less people, but you won't be able to grow a business with no people. So you need to grow a business through growing its culture. You need to make sure that this business has values. I had a business called Fluid. This business went on to become one of the most successful creative agencies in Asia that I sold to PricewaterhouseCoopers for more money than I'll ever need.

他们让我以很低的价格回购了那些股权。他们非常通情达理，没有以此要挟我。当然，如果你在目标导向下雇用了合适的人并给予了他们股权，大多数优秀的人不会以此要挟你来收回股权。你可以保持理性。但如果你一开始就通过给予股权做了正确的事，事情就会变得很简单。现在我要告诉你的第三件事，这与如何发展业务密切相关：没有员工就无法发展业务。我认为，在当今人工智能和所有技术发展的背景下，你可以用更少的员工来发展业务，但不可能完全没有员工。所以你需要通过培育企业文化来发展业务。你需要确保这个企业拥有价值观。我曾有一家名为Fluid的企业。这家公司后来成为亚洲最成功的创意机构之一，我将其出售给普华永道，获得的资金远超我所需。

and one of the things I did in the early days of that business which was a big mistake is I built a business to make money. Now that might not sound like a mistake, but what happened first year I hired people there were knew it was exciting. Second year people started to leave. Why did they leave? Because the values of the business were wrong. I changed the values in that business. We went from a business that was designed to make money to a business that would protect the staff from bad clients. I had a creative agency often designers were treated badly. Do this by tomorrow at 12 I need it instead of understanding that creativity is a process. So we switched our whole model instead of working for clients we worked for the creative people and help them manage clients. That transformed our business and helped us grow by thinking about things differently instead of traditionally. You will grow your business and by looking after your people it's cheesy I know you can grow much easier now when you grow assuming you follow my advice and you grow your business. This is the important thing you need to identify what is your destination what are you actually

我在创业初期犯的一个重大错误就是纯粹为了赚钱而建立企业。这听起来可能不算错误，但第一年我招聘员工时大家都觉得充满激情。第二年员工开始陆续离职。他们为何离开？因为企业的价值观出了问题。我改变了那家企业的价值观。我们从一家以赚钱为目的的企业转变为保护员工免受不良客户侵害的企业。我经营着一家创意机构，设计师们经常受到恶劣对待。客户总是要求"明天12点前完成这个"，却不理解创意是一个过程。因此我们彻底转变了模式，不再为客户工作，而是为创意人才服务，帮助他们管理客户。这彻底改变了我们的业务，让我们通过非传统的思维方式实现了增长。照顾好你的员工虽然听起来老套，但遵循我的建议，你的企业就能更轻松地发展壮大。关键在于你需要明确自己的目标定位，你真正要成为的是

You need to identify what is your destination, what are you actually growing for. Now I have a lot of people recently approached me and say please invest in my business, and I want to grow it. My first question is why? What is it you're trying to do by growing your business? What's the real reason you're growing your business? Is it ego? Do you really want to work more? Or is it want to make the business bigger so you can bring in management so you can not have to work so hard? So you're working hard now to grow it, that's fine. I think you need a reason to grow it. Now I want to grow the biggest platform in the world that helps people for free learn business, so I want it to be big. I know my destination. I want to help 10 million people for free start a business they love and never feel alone doing it. So I know my destination and therefore I'm growing both from a higher point of view from a culture point of view in that direction. But I have had points in my life and the early days of fluid where actually I wanted to work three days a

你需要明确自己的目标，你究竟为了什么而发展事业。最近有很多人来找我，说请投资我的生意，我想要扩大规模。我的第一个问题是为什么？你通过扩大业务想要实现什么？你发展业务的真正原因是什么？是为了自我满足吗？你真的想工作更长时间吗？还是想让业务规模更大，这样你就可以引入管理层，从而不必如此辛苦工作？所以你现在努力工作来发展业务，这没问题。但我认为你需要一个发展的理由。现在我想打造世界上最大的平台，免费帮助人们学习商业知识，所以我希望它规模庞大。我知道自己的目标。我想免费帮助1000万人创办他们热爱的事业，并且在创业过程中从不感到孤单。因此我知道自己的目标，所以我现在正从更高层次和文化角度朝着那个方向全面发展。但在我人生的某些阶段和Fluid早期，实际上我曾希望每周工作三天

I spent four days a week doing cool stuff with brands and two days a week going to the beach with my girlfriend, having fun. I didn't grow the business too much at the beginning. I actually had a different ambition, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you want to grow your business, follow this formula: have purpose, bring in people that have value and own value in the business, and you will grow if you look after them and your customer base. The final thing I'll talk about when it comes to really building a business and making a business successful is first of all take risk. Make sure that you build MVPs, minimum viable products, and try things out. If you really want to build a company, you can't stay stagnant. No company today is around when they stay stagnant. Think about Blockbuster or any of these businesses that just sat on their technology like Kodak and didn't do anything with it. You can't sit still. Kodak invented the digital camera. You can't sit still, you have to put these things into the market. Kodak didn't want to put their film digital camera into the market.

我每周花四天时间与品牌合作做很酷的事情，每周花两天时间和女朋友去海滩玩耍。起初我没有过多扩展业务，实际上我有着不同的抱负，这并没有什么错。如果你想发展业务，请遵循这个公式：要有目标，引进在业务中具有价值和拥有价值的人才，如果你照顾好他们和你的客户群，你就会成长。关于真正建立企业并使其成功的最后一点是首先要承担风险。确保你构建最小可行产品（MVP）并进行尝试。如果你真的想建立一家公司，就不能停滞不前。如今没有哪家公司能在停滞不前的情况下生存。想想百视达或任何像柯达这样只守着技术却无所作为的企业。你不能停滞不前。柯达发明了数码相机。你不能停滞不前，必须将这些产品推向市场。柯达不愿意将他们的胶片数码相机推向市场。

Because it would have meant film was gone and film was their core business. You've got to disrupt yourself if you really want to build a business that's going to last. If you really want to build a successful company, I'm going to use a dirty word that I personally hate but has saved me: you need to build systems. You need to move from what is often in the early days of a business, what I call a generalist mindset where everybody can do everything, to a specialist mindset. You need to allow people to be specialists in certain areas. When I was younger, I was a generalist. I can do kind of everything. I can clean the toilets in the company when they're dirty. I can help people get their car loaded up and get to the site to do the pitch. I can do the pitch. I could do everything, but I became a specialist in marketing. I think as you grow a business, you have to take away the generalist people and build out specialist people who do a particular thing well to help the business grow.

因为这意味着胶片业务将消失，而胶片是他们的核心业务。如果你真的想建立一个持久的企业，就必须自我颠覆。如果你真的想建立一个成功的公司，我要用一个我自己讨厌但救了我的词：你需要建立系统。你需要从企业早期常见的通才思维模式，即每个人都能做所有事情，转变为专家思维模式。你需要允许人们在特定领域成为专家。当我年轻时，我是一个通才。我几乎什么都能做。我可以清洁公司里脏了的厕所。我可以帮人们装车并前往场地进行推销。我可以做推销。我什么都能做，但我后来成为了营销专家。我认为随着企业的发展，你必须淘汰通才，培养能够做好特定事情来帮助企业发展的专家。

and that involves building systems that allow people to do that in your hiring process, in your growing process and in your mindset. Even you as a founder potentially have to make sure that you learn a skill set, otherwise you become redundant, which by the way is fine. I have often got myself replaced in a company that I have built. I think that's actually pretty smart. Unless you can become a specialist, it's probably the best thing for the company too. There's likely to be a CEO out there that's better than you when you're at scale. I found that to be the case many times. I replaced myself at Fluid 11 years in by someone who was a better CEO than me. So hopefully if you know your purpose and you give purpose to the people you hire, you have equity both for your team and for the wider growth of the business, you know your values and you apply them, you know your destination and you apply this very important point of systems and removing generalism, you will have a business that is easy to hire people, that will scale and will build into something that lives without you.

这需要建立系统，使人们能够在招聘流程、成长过程以及思维模式中实现这一目标。即使作为创始人，你也可能需要确保自己学习新技能，否则就会变得多余——顺便说一句，这没什么不好。我经常在自己创建的公司里被替代，我认为这其实相当明智。除非你能成为专家，否则这对公司来说也可能是最好的选择。当企业达到一定规模时，很可能会有比你更优秀的CEO出现。我多次发现这种情况属实。在Fluid公司任职11年时，我让一位比我更优秀的CEO接替了自己。因此，如果你能明确自身目标并赋予员工使命感，为团队和企业更广泛的发展创造公平环境，恪守价值观并付诸实践，明确发展方向并运用系统化方法消除通才模式，那么你将建立起一个易于招聘人才、具备扩展能力、最终能独立运作而不依赖于你的企业。

I learned long ago a system that I call the seven and eight rule. It's very simple and obvious when I first start explaining it. If someone's in your company and they are really good like you love them, they love you, they're obviously a nine and ten. You want to keep them and you want them to stay, and they want to stay. Most of the time those people are nine and ten because they're enjoying it. Now of course, like I said earlier, make sure you give these people equity, make sure you look after these people over time. But you know you want to keep them and they want to stay, it's a no-brainer, it's cool. Then you have what I call the ones and twos. These are people who are at their job, they know they're at their job, you know they're at their job. And most of the time they either quit or you fire them. It's a no-brainer, everyone feels it. They don't turn up on time, they don't care about the purpose of the company, whatever it is. It's obvious that relationship comes to an end naturally.

我很久以前学会了一个我称之为"七八法则"的系统。当我最初开始解释它时，它非常简单明了。如果公司里有人表现非常出色，比如你喜欢他们，他们也喜欢你，那他们显然是九分和十分员工。你想要留住他们，希望他们留下，而他们也想留下。大多数时候这些人都是九分和十分，因为他们很享受工作。当然，就像我之前说的，要确保给这些人股权，确保长期照顾好这些人。但你知道你想留住他们，他们也想留下，这是显而易见的，很酷。然后是我称之为一分和两分的员工。这些人只是在应付工作，他们知道自己只是在应付工作，你也知道他们只是在应付工作。大多数时候，他们要么辞职，要么被你解雇。这是显而易见的，每个人都能感觉到。他们不准时上班，不关心公司的目标，不管那是什么。很明显这种关系会自然结束。

As a leader, there are things you can do to check whether that person can get better at their job and if there's anything you can do to support them. But in the end, learn the seven and eight rule. I have seen this and kept sevens and eights in my companies in the past, while the nines and tens leave. If someone can get away with not doing their job without repercussions, then why would a nine and ten stay? Why would a nine and ten remain nines and tens if they can get lazy, not work as hard, or cut corners without getting fired? Then you're going to have a problem. Nines and tens will not stay in your business, and you'll have a company full of sevens and eights. Sevens and eights are hard to manage and take up nearly all HR conversations. You have to learn to grow a pair of balls and fire these people. You know what? When you do this - and this has happened to me many times - they're grateful because those sevens and eights, if you fire them.

作为领导者，你可以采取一些措施来评估员工能否在工作中有所改进，以及你能否提供任何支持。但最终，要学会七分和八分法则。我亲眼见过这种情况，过去我的公司里留住了七分和八分员工，而九分和十分员工却离开了。如果有人能够逃避工作责任而不受惩罚，那么九分和十分员工为何要留下？如果他们可以变得懒惰、不努力工作或偷工减料而不被解雇，九分和十分员工为何还要保持优秀？这样你就会遇到问题。九分和十分员工不会留在你的企业，你的公司将充满七分和八分员工。七分和八分员工难以管理，几乎占据了所有人力资源对话。你必须学会果断行事，解雇这些人。你知道吗？当你这样做时——这种情况在我身上发生过很多次——他们会感激你，因为那些七分和八分员工，如果你解雇他们。

They're grateful because those sevens and eights, if you fire them, can often go on to find a job they like where they are a nine and ten and are appreciated. It's your responsibility to fire sevens and eights. So how can you identify if someone is a seven and eight? Well, the rule I have is how many times a day are you talking about them. If they come up too much in any conversation amongst your team members or even your customers more than once or twice in a week, you probably got a problem. The second thing is you often are running a system in your brain where you are fearful of not finding a replacement, so you don't want to fire them because they're better than nobody. I've done this myself many times. A seven and eight is at least a pair of hands helping you when you're building a business. Sometimes that's a relief, and the idea of having to find someone new is painful. So you need to get strong. You need to realize and maybe even line up your next hire before you fire. Now I promise you that employee, and I would be the same, is also looking for another job.

他们心怀感激，因为那些七分和八分的员工，如果你解雇他们，往往能找到自己喜欢的工作，在那里他们会成为九分或十分员工并受到赏识。解雇七分和八分员工是你的责任。那么如何判断某人是否属于七分或八分员工呢？我的判断标准是：你每天会提到他们多少次。如果他们在团队成员甚至客户的谈话中出现过于频繁，一周超过一两次，那你可能就遇到问题了。第二点是，你脑海中经常会有这样的顾虑：害怕找不到替代者，所以不想解雇他们，因为有人总比没人强。我自己也多次这样做过。在创业过程中，七分或八分员工至少是能帮上忙的人手。有时这是一种安慰，而寻找新人的想法令人痛苦。所以你需要变得坚强。你需要意识到，甚至可能在解雇之前就安排好下一个招聘。现在我向你保证，那位员工，换作我也会如此，同样也在寻找另一份工作。

So maybe what you can do is help them find that other job. I have done this many times. I've gone to someone who's a seven and eight and said you're not happy. I don't think you're completely doing the job the way you should. I've helped you get an interview at this other company. It has actually built relationships with people that weren't happy in the company but are now my friends outside of work. You can help that person even though it might be frustrating that the person's in your company and not performing. The best thing you can do is work out a solution for them and for you. And you can build a great relationship with that person even though it's perhaps not a great relationship in the company right now by helping them move on. So following the rule: identify seven and eights, be honest with yourself, do not have fear that you cannot replace them and find a nine and ten. You will help that seven and eight find a new job and always be honest with seven and eight how you're feeling. It will be better for you and for them.

也许你能做的是帮助他们找到其他工作。我这样做过很多次。我曾去找那些七分或八分的员工，告诉他们：你并不快乐。我认为你没有完全按照应有的方式完成工作。我已经帮你在另一家公司安排了面试。这实际上与那些在公司不开心的人建立了关系，他们现在成了我工作之外的朋友。即使这个人在你的公司表现不佳让你感到沮丧，你仍然可以帮助他。你能做的最好的事情就是为他们和你自己找到一个解决方案。通过帮助他们继续前进，你可以与那个人建立良好的关系，即使目前在公司的关系可能并不理想。所以要遵循这个原则：识别七分和八分员工，对自己诚实，不要害怕无法替代他们并找到九分和十分的员工。你将帮助那些七分和八分员工找到新工作，并且始终诚实地告诉他们你的感受。这对你和对他们都会更好。

and there is a

Sometimes that person becomes a nine or ten, and it can often happen when you give them equity. Let's talk about how to go global now. Why is going global one of my main points? It's because many people don't realize they can go global, and many don't realize they'll probably reduce a lot of risk in their business if they do. Why? Well, if you're in more than one market and the market you're in is in trouble, you spread your risk. I've had this happen to me many times early in my career with Fluid. We were only in Hong Kong, and it was risky. Hong Kong had many ups and downs, and when we had the downs, I was completely subject to that downturn. I had no counterbalance with a business potentially doing well in another market. And going global, it turns out, is not difficult anymore. Often people don't realize there are a few steps to allow your business to go global when you didn't think it was even possible. So what are those steps?

有时那个人会变成九分或十分，而这种情况往往发生在你给予他们股权时。现在让我们谈谈如何走向全球。为什么走向全球是我的主要观点之一？这是因为许多人没有意识到他们可以走向全球，许多人也没有意识到如果这样做，他们可能会减少业务中的很多风险。为什么？因为如果你在多个市场运营，而你所在的市场陷入困境，你就分散了风险。在我早期职业生涯中，这种情况在我身上发生过很多次，当时我在Fluid工作。我们只在香港，这很冒险。香港经历了许多起伏，当低谷来临时，我完全受制于这种低迷。我没有一个可能在另一个市场表现良好的业务来平衡风险。事实证明，走向全球已经不再困难。通常人们没有意识到，即使你认为不可能，也有几个步骤可以让你的业务走向全球。那么这些步骤是什么呢？

I can't afford Senior Management. I can't afford to get help. I can't afford to actually stop working for a week. I'm telling you now by thinking Global you give yourself a chance to grow a big business and it's easier than having a small business despite what you've been told by other people. Get a big business if you can now. It does link back to what your mission in life is. Maybe you don't want a big business but do not decide to not have a big business because you think it's easier to have a small business. It's not. Small is not easier. I have run big businesses and I have run small businesses and I had an easier life once I've made the business big. So do not trap yourself in any Market. Do not subject yourself to any Market that could disrupt your business and make sure you always give yourself the chance to be free of your very own business not trapping you.

我负担不起高级管理层。我负担不起寻求帮助。我负担不起真正停止工作一周。我现在告诉你，通过全球化思维，你给自己一个发展大企业的机会，这比经营小企业更容易，尽管别人告诉你的可能不同。如果可能的话，现在就建立大企业。这确实与你的人生使命相关联。也许你不想要大企业，但不要因为认为经营小企业更容易而决定不建立大企业。事实并非如此。小企业并不容易。我经营过大企业，也经营过小企业，一旦我把企业做大，我的生活就变得更轻松。所以不要把自己困在任何市场中。不要让自己受制于任何可能扰乱你业务的市场，确保你始终给自己机会，让你自己的业务不会困住你。

How to get a mentor? This is the single biggest question I ever get asked, and it's so simple to answer, but no one seems to listen to me. I'm going to try anyway. If you want a mentor in your business, I totally understand why that sounds cool. But the reality is, people have built businesses around this concept that you need a mentor, and they've sold you it as the solution. It isn't. What you actually need is not a mentor. What you need in reality is someone who can answer the questions that you have, and perhaps even give you the answers to questions you didn't know to ask. This can all be done without a mentor. In fact, I would argue if you got me as your mentor, it would be pretty annoying because a mentor will tell you their experience, but it might not be relevant to your life. This video today, in a way, is all the knowledge I have anyway. So of course you can still have me as your mentor. But what you're really saying, if you're honest about it, is you're looking for a coach. You're looking for someone to keep you accountable. And you can actually break down what that means into what you really need. If you want someone to work with you in your business and keep you accountable, get a co-founder.

如何找到导师？这是我被问及最多的问题，答案其实很简单，但似乎没人愿意听我说。尽管如此，我还是想尝试解释一下。如果你想在事业上找到一位导师，我完全理解这听起来很酷。但现实是，有人围绕"你需要导师"这个概念建立了商业体系，并将其作为解决方案推销给你。事实并非如此。你真正需要的不是导师。实际上，你需要的是能够回答你问题的人，甚至能为你解答那些你没想到要问的问题。这一切都不需要导师就能实现。事实上，我认为如果让我当你的导师，可能会很烦人，因为导师会分享他们的经验，但这些经验可能并不适用于你的生活。从某种意义上说，今天这个视频已经包含了我所有的知识。所以你当然还是可以把我当作你的导师。但如果你诚实面对，你真正想要的是一个教练。你在寻找一个能让你保持责任感的人。你可以将这种需求分解为你真正需要的东西。如果你想找个人和你一起经营事业并让你保持责任感，那就找个联合创始人吧。

If you want someone to help you with sales, hire a salesperson. If you know the question you want to ask, then ask it now. I say all that, I still want to deliver on a promise to help you get a mentor, and this is how you get a mentor. Number one, you research what matters. What matters to that person? Someone reached out to me yesterday asking me to be their mentor for a property development business they want to run. Do you not know who I am? I hate the property industry and everything it stands for. I think property should be a basic human right, and the present ballot system has screwed the world up. I don't want to help someone do that. Now they were very nice and very polite, I won't name who they are, but I'm telling you right now, do your research before you ask someone for help. Of course, I'm not going to reply to that fact. I did reply saying no, but I'm saying that most people won't reply. You don't want to ask someone to be your mentor and have not done the research on them.

如果你想找人帮你做销售，那就雇个销售员。如果你知道想问什么问题，现在就去问。说了这么多，我仍然想兑现帮你找到导师的承诺，以下是获得导师的方法。第一，研究重要事项。对那个人来说什么最重要？昨天有人联系我，想让我当他们房地产开发生意的导师。你难道不知道我是谁吗？我讨厌房地产行业及其代表的一切。我认为房产应该是基本人权，而目前的投票制度搞乱了世界。我不想帮人做这种事。他们虽然非常友善礼貌，我不会透露他们的名字，但我现在告诉你，在向他人求助前请先做好调研。当然我不会回复这种请求。我确实回复了拒绝，但我要说大多数人根本不会回复。你肯定不希望请人当导师却对他们毫无了解。

So you can go and write a question to 100, 5,000 potential mentors. Now if after all this you're still set on getting a mentor, another way to get a mentor is change the word mentor to advisor. When you're looking to build a company for example, and maybe you want a mentor to help you build a company, look for someone that has specific knowledge that you're after and ask them to join your Advisory Board. Now advisory boards are a little bit more glamorous for most people. A mentor isn't something you see on many people's LinkedIn profile, but advisor to this company and advisor to that company often is. So reframe it as advisory. Now if you've got a business with purpose and you followed the other things I've said in this long video today, you'll know how important things like process and systems and structure and goal will lead you to decide what type of advisor you need. And it's much easier to get an advisor than it is a mentor and much easier to structure what the relationship is like. If they're for example one of your board advisers, they'd probably have equity in your business.

因此你可以向100位、5000位潜在导师提出咨询。如果在经历了这一切之后，你仍然坚持要寻找导师，另一种方法是把"导师"这个词替换为"顾问"。例如当你打算创立公司时，或许需要导师协助创业，这时应该寻找掌握你所需专业知识的人，邀请他们加入你的顾问委员会。对大多数人而言，顾问头衔显得更光鲜。在领英档案上很少看到有人标注导师身份，但标注某公司顾问、某企业咨询师的情况却很常见。所以请将其重新定义为顾问角色。如果你拥有目标明确的业务，并且遵循了本期长视频中我提到的其他建议，你就会明白流程、体系、架构和目标等因素对于确定所需顾问类型的重要性。聘请顾问远比寻找导师容易得多，也更容易规范合作关系。例如若对方担任你的董事会顾问，他们很可能获得公司股权。

So you're no longer asking someone to hang out with you and give you a bit of advice and motivate you. You're asking someone to give you specific knowledge around something they love and believe in, and it's much, much easier. The next thing you can do to help yourself get a mentor is connect to the people that they are connected to. So referrals are the best way to get help. Many times someone I know for a long time that's helped me out has asked me to mentor someone to help them out, and I have done it without question. Referrals are so powerful, just like in sales and the other things I've mentioned today. Try to get someone to refer you to the mentor that you want. It's also much easier for someone to say yes when they've got some reference point of someone that knows you. Now be careful, don't go become friends with someone just to get them to refer you. It'll be transparent and actually hurt you, so do it genuinely. But if you can get a referral for the mentor that you need, it's very powerful.

因此，你不再只是请求别人与你相处、给你一些建议和激励，而是请求对方就他们热爱并信仰的事物给予你具体的知识，这样会容易得多。帮助自己获得导师的下一个方法是与他们所联系的人建立关系。推荐是获得帮助的最佳途径。很多时候，长期帮助我的人会请我指导他人，我毫不犹豫地答应了。正如我今天提到的销售和其他事情一样，推荐非常有效。尝试请人推荐你给你想要的导师。当对方有认识你的人作为参考点时，他们更容易答应。但要注意，不要仅仅为了获得推荐而与人交朋友。这会显得虚伪，反而会伤害你，所以要真诚行事。但如果你能获得所需导师的推荐，这将非常有效。

Now the final way to get a mentor, if that's what you want, the best way is to give value to the person you want as a mentor. Some of the people I've helped in my past have helped me first; I didn't ask them to. For example, someone redesigned a website for me and made my website better. Of course, after someone's gone and made all that effort to support me and help me, I'm going to give them time. I think that time in the early days allows us to work together to define the questions they're asking and define the things that that person actually needs. So go and give value to the person that you want as your mentor. Don't just ask them for something; try to bring them something, and it will make a huge difference. I think that's one of the things that people never do; they just want to extract value. This goes back to my personal philosophy in life: it's not give and take, it's give without take. If you follow give without take when trying to get a mentor, I'm pretty sure you'll get that.

现在，如果你想找到导师，最好的方法就是为你想要成为你导师的人提供价值。过去我帮助过的一些人首先帮助了我，我并没有要求他们这样做。例如，有人为我重新设计了一个网站，让我的网站变得更好。当然，在有人付出这么多努力来支持和帮助我之后，我会给他们时间。我认为早期的这段时间让我们能够共同确定他们提出的问题，并明确那个人真正需要的东西。所以，去为你想要成为你导师的人提供价值。不要只是向他们索取什么，试着给他们带来一些东西，这将产生巨大的影响。我认为这是人们从不做的事情之一，他们只想获取价值。这回到了我的人生哲学：不是给予和索取，而是给予而不索取。如果你在寻找导师时遵循给予而不索取的原则，我相信你会成功的。

No mentor, but don't expect anything. Don't expect that person to become your mentor. Give them value, give them respect. Clearly you respect them, you want them to be your mentor. Make the effort and over time it will come back to you, even if it isn't in that person becoming your mentor.

没有导师，但不要期待任何回报。不要期望那个人会成为你的导师。给予他们价值，给予他们尊重。显然你尊重他们，你希望他们成为你的导师。付出努力，随着时间的推移，这份付出会回报给你，即使最终那个人没有成为你的导师。

How equity works is such an important subject. If you don't get the equity structure right in your business, you will fail. I have been involved in many businesses that didn't do this right and collapsed, not because they weren't good businesses but because they didn't know how the structure of equity works.

股权如何运作是一个非常重要的课题。如果你的企业没有建立正确的股权结构，你将会失败。我参与过许多没有正确处理这个问题而倒闭的企业，不是因为它们不是好企业，而是因为它们不了解股权结构的运作方式。

Now just before I get into the detail of how to structure your equity correctly in the future, I will make sure that you understand one important point. Most people don't want to drop below 50% equity in the company because they think it means they lose control. That's not true. You are able to control your company under the operational agreement. Now in each country - US, Britain, different markets - you have different terminology for this, but you control your company by the shareholder agreement.

在我深入讲解未来如何正确构建股权结构之前，我要确保你们理解一个重要观点。大多数人不想在公司中持股比例低于50%，因为他们认为这意味着失去控制权。这不是真的。根据运营协议，你仍然能够控制公司。在不同的国家 - 美国、英国、不同市场 - 对此有不同的术语，但你是通过股东协议来控制公司的。

You don't control your company by the amount of equity that you hold. So if for example you have a 50/50 equity split with someone, you are actually potentially in joint control as far as equity is concerned. But you can still allocate one person to make all the decisions and have actual control. So do make sure that you understand that equity ownership does not equal control right. It does not equal control. Keep an eye on this mindset because you often make big mistakes around equity ownership thinking it means you lose control if you drop below 50%, and that is not true. The second thing to keep in mind with equity is understanding where you're going with the business. Everything I've already discussed in this video is interl, but if you don't know where you're going, you don't know how much equity you need to get there. Too many people sell a large chunk of equity at the early stages of their business only to realize later in their business they don't have enough equity to get to the finish line. If your model is like tech company model and you intend to raise a lot of money, you have to be

你无法通过持有的股权比例来控制公司。例如，如果你与某人各持50%股权，就股权而言你们实际上可能处于共同控制状态。但你仍然可以指定一个人做出所有决策并拥有实际控制权。因此务必理解股权所有权不等于控制权。它不等于控制权。要警惕这种思维定式，因为人们常在股权问题上犯大错，认为持股比例低于50%就会失去控制权，这并不正确。关于股权需要记住的第二点是明确企业的发展方向。我在本视频中讨论的所有内容都是相互关联的，但如果你不清楚发展方向，就不知道需要多少股权才能达成目标。太多人在创业初期出售大量股权，结果后来发现没有足够股权支撑企业走到终点。如果你的模式类似科技公司模式并打算筹集大量资金，你必须

You have to be very cautious with the equity in the early days. Now there are all sorts of graphs and information on the internet that will explain this point to you, but I'm highlighting it to you so you can go and research it. It's a very deep subject, but do not sell too much equity at the beginning. Having said that, the best thing you can ever do is sell no equity at all. I know it's cool to raise money, but it's cooler to run a business where you don't raise money. A bootstrap business in my opinion is healthier. You can retain 100% control and 100% ownership of equity. It's always probably going to be better. Now there's a lot of exceptions to that suggestion, and one of them I would say is make sure you don't make this one big mistake I see a lot of people make. I have seen people start businesses and when they start businesses with a partner they do 52% 48%, and often for no other reason than the person who came up with the idea believes that they deserve 2% more. This has happened time and time again. It's a huge

在创业初期你必须非常谨慎地处理股权问题。现在网上有各种图表和信息会向你解释这一点，但我特别向你强调这一点，以便你可以去研究它。这是一个非常深奥的话题，但不要在开始时出售过多股权。话虽如此，你能做的最好的事情就是完全不转让股权。我知道融资很酷，但经营一家不需要融资的企业更酷。在我看来，自筹资金的企业更健康。你可以保留100%的控制权和100%的股权所有权。这通常可能会更好。当然这个建议有很多例外情况，其中我要说的是确保不要犯这个我见过很多人犯的大错误。我见过人们创业时，当他们与合伙人一起创业时，他们会分配52%和48%的股权，往往没有其他原因，只是提出想法的人认为自己应该多拿2%。这种情况一次又一次地发生。这是一个巨大的

Now the best way to avoid conflict and avoid even needing to turn to your board of advisors is to be very clear about where you're both going. I'm using at the moment in this equity example a 50/50 partnership. It could equally be a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 or 1/4, 1/4, 1/4. I'm just using this as an example that you all know where you're going. I have seen problems in the business, for example where someone is building the business, the money's coming in, one person wants to take the money out and put it in their pocket as profit, the other person wants to put it back into the business to help it grow. One person wants to stay in one market, the UK, another person wants to expand to the US. You need to try and work out all of this stuff ideally before you even start the company within your mind map that I taught you earlier. You figure out where you're going and why, and therefore you avoid conflict when it comes to major decision making later. Again, I have seen companies fall apart because one person wanted to take the money out and one person didn't, and literally the business collapses because the two don't agree, don't get along.

避免冲突甚至无需求助董事会的最佳方法是明确双方的共同目标。我目前以50/50的股权合作为例，这同样适用于1/3、1/3、1/3或1/4、1/4、1/4的分配方式。我以此为例说明所有人都应明确发展方向。我见证过企业中出现的问题，例如当业务发展资金流入时，一方希望将资金作为利润收入囊中，另一方则希望将资金重新投入业务以促进增长。一方希望固守英国市场，另一方则希望拓展美国市场。你们需要在我之前教授的心智图框架内，最好在创立公司前就解决所有这些问题。明确发展方向及原因，从而在后续重大决策时避免冲突。我再次目睹公司因一方希望提取资金而另一方反对导致解体，企业因双方意见不合、无法协作而真正垮塌。

The business fails. Equity ownership under this system I'm now teaching you is not about control, as I've mentioned, but it is about understanding what the equity is there to do. Now depending on your structure, if you're a charity this won't matter so much, but if you're a limited company that's looking to raise money, please make sure your cap table has the right people on it. I have seen many people not get investment because they gave 2% to the wrong person that the other investors don't want associated with. Equity ownership will tarnish your reputation. Understand how equity is structured - it's showing who is involved in the company, so you need to make sure that you align your brand. I talked about branding earlier to the equity ownership, and whoever owns that company, whoever owns a part of your company will affect the brand image, so make sure that you're aligning your brand values with your equity ownership. Now there is a lot of talk by me and anyone that actually knows what they're doing in business about giving equity to your staff. I really believe in this, and now there's a couple of ways to do it.

企业会失败。我现在教你的这个体系下的股权所有权不是关于控制权，正如我提到的，而是关于理解股权的目的所在。根据你的结构不同，如果你是慈善机构，这就不那么重要，但如果你是一家寻求融资的有限公司，请确保你的股权结构表上有合适的人选。我见过很多人因为把2%的股份给了错误的人而无法获得投资，其他投资者不希望与这个人有关联。股权所有权会损害你的声誉。要理解股权是如何构建的——它显示了谁参与了公司，所以你需要确保你的品牌与之匹配。我之前谈到过品牌与股权所有权的关系，无论谁拥有那家公司，谁拥有你公司的一部分都会影响品牌形象，所以请确保你的品牌价值与股权所有权保持一致。现在我和任何真正懂商业的人都在大量讨论给员工股权的问题。我真的很相信这一点，现在有几种方法可以实现。

There are a couple of ways to do it. I honestly think if you want to build a business that scales, you have to give equity to your people. But there are two types of equity structure: what we call share options, which technically isn't actually equity—it's a percentage in the future of the company, but it can often be framed as earn-outs or straight-up equity. There is a hybrid in this model, and I don't want to get too technical because I'm actually not a lawyer, but I want you to understand the difference. Most of the time, people buying stocks and shares in the stock market have share options, which means they'll get given shares, but those shares have no class level, so they have no decision-making power. You can own shares in the company through the stock market but have no influence over that business or control. That is one way to incentivize people: you give them share options. My preferred method, and everyone on my team had this, is actual physical equity in the company—not share options via the stock market listing, but real-life equity in the

有几种方法可以做到这一点。我真诚地认为，如果你想建立一个可扩展的企业，就必须给予员工股权。但有两种股权结构：我们称之为股票期权，这在技术上并非真正的股权，而是公司未来收益的百分比，但通常以盈利支付或直接股权的形式呈现。这种模式中存在混合形式，我不想讲得太技术性，因为我实际上不是律师，但我想让你理解其中的区别。大多数时候，人们在股市购买股票拥有的是股票期权，这意味着他们将获得股份，但这些股份没有类别等级，因此没有决策权。你可以通过股市持有公司股份，但对该企业没有影响力或控制权。这是一种激励员工的方式：给予他们股票期权。我偏好的方法，也是我团队每个成员都拥有的，是公司实际的有形股权——不是通过上市获得的股票期权，而是实际业务中的真实股权。

Real-life equity in the company means if the company was sold today, they would get paid out. Whereas often with share options, it's linked to the stock market listing. In some cases if it's already listed, you're selling the shares on the stock market. But if the company decided to take the company off the stock market, wherever that price was, you'd have to sell out. There are some legal obligations around this - it has to be more than 70% of the shareholders agree. But the point is, I have owned shares in the stock market of a company that I believed in, and then the owners of that company, the actual equity owners of that company, decided to take the company off the stock market. I had no choice but to sell my shares. That company delisted and became worth a billion dollars, and I could have owned it but I wasn't allowed because I only owned the share option side, the stock market side, not actual physical equity in the actual company. I think it's important if you're even thinking about investing in a company to understand the difference. Of course, if you're going to work in a company, understand the difference.

公司实际股权意味着如果公司今天被出售，他们将获得支付。而股票期权通常与股市上市挂钩。在某些情况下，如果公司已经上市，你是在股市上出售股票。但如果公司决定从股市退市，无论当时价格如何，你都必须卖出。这方面有一些法律义务——必须超过70%的股东同意。但关键是，我曾持有一家我信任的公司的股市股票，然后该公司的所有者，即公司的实际股权所有者，决定让公司从股市退市。我别无选择，只能出售我的股票。那家公司退市后价值达到十亿美元，我本可以持有它，但我无法做到，因为我只拥有股票期权部分，即股市部分，而不是公司中的实际实体股权。我认为，即使你只是考虑投资一家公司，理解这种区别也很重要。当然，如果你要去一家公司工作，也要理解这种区别。

If you are building a company and you don't understand the difference, you are going to have a major problem in the future. Now this subject of share ownership, understanding the different classes, please spend time understanding the different classes. Go Google how it works, go Google share options, go Google stock market shares, go Google equity ownership. This stuff is complex, and it's going to be too. I'm not legal to go through all with you now, but this structure of share ownership can literally make or break a company. I would also finally say to you, depending on what your end goal is, is how you should reverse engineer your share equity ownership. If you are looking to IPO your business, then you want to make sure that the IPO process is fully understood of course, but your stock is reversed backwards. So when you start the business and you're looking to list it one day, you need to know that when you're starting the business ideally, because if you don't structure it early on to eventually get listed, it probably won't. Now I learned this the hard way with a few businesses that I was involved in the

如果你正在创办公司却不了解这些区别，未来将会面临严重问题。股权所有权的主题涉及理解不同类别股份，请务必花时间研究不同类别。去谷歌搜索运作原理，去谷歌搜索股票期权，去谷歌搜索股市股份，去谷歌搜索股权所有权。这些内容很复杂，而且会越来越复杂。我并非法律专业人士，无法与你详细探讨所有细节，但股权结构确实能决定企业的成败。最后我还要强调，应根据最终目标来逆向设计股权结构。若计划让企业上市，不仅要确保完全理解IPO流程，还要注意股权是反向设置的。因此当你创立公司并期待未来上市时，理想情况下在创业初期就要明确：如果不及早构建适合上市的股权架构，最终很可能无法实现上市。这一点是我通过亲身参与多个企业实践得出的深刻教训

The share structure was so complicated we couldn't get all the shareholders to agree to even do an IPO. Some shareholders wanted to keep it private, other shareholders wanted to do an IPO, and it gets so messy because they didn't know where they were going in the early days. So learn to structure what I call reverse engineering: know what your end goal is and reverse the share equity structure from day one under that premise. Now there's one final thing I'll teach you about equity: sometimes it's hard to determine the value of your company to sell equity. So one thing you should look into and perhaps use is products like a SAFE. Now platforms like Y Combinator, one of famous accelerators out there that help businesses grow, use a SAFE to help determine a business and its long-term potential for value. There's many different ways to structure a SAFE, but the beautiful thing about that model is you don't need to determine the value of your business now. Someone can invest in your business on a discount of the value in the future.

股权结构过于复杂，我们甚至无法让所有股东就进行首次公开募股达成一致。部分股东希望保持私有化，其他股东则希望上市，由于早期发展方向不明确，局面变得十分混乱。因此要学会构建我称之为"逆向工程"的架构：明确你的最终目标，并在此前提下从第一天起就倒推设计股权结构。关于股权，我还要教你最后一课：有时很难确定公司价值以出售股权。你可以考虑使用SAFE这类工具。像Y Combinator这样帮助企业发展成长的知名加速器平台，就使用SAFE来评估企业及其长期价值潜力。构建SAFE有多种方式，但该模式的妙处在于无需立即确定企业当前价值。投资者可以基于未来价值的折扣对你的企业进行投资。

But the concept of SAFE I have found to be very useful, especially in the early days of building a business, to take away the conversation about what your business is worth and move towards investing in this business. This is what we're going to do. It's much easier to get an investor, for example. Frankly, it's much easier to incentivize your employees with it. You're not determining a value on the stock share now, so it doesn't cause tax implications as well. I really think it's useful and not many people know about it, so I hope this overview in equity gives you a good understanding of how it works. I am going to do a whole video on this much more detailed. I'm going to get some lawyers involved too to show you the different agreements and how it works. But if you go do a little bit of Googling, you'll get most of the information you need that I haven't provided here. If you have any questions about equity, feel free to drop them in the comments.

我发现SAFE（未来股权简单协议）的概念非常实用，尤其是在创业初期，它可以避免讨论企业估值问题，转而关注业务投资。这正是我们要采取的方式。例如，这样更容易吸引投资者。坦率地说，用它来激励员工也更为便捷。由于现在不需确定股权价值，还能避免税务影响。我认为这非常实用但鲜为人知，希望本次股权概述能帮助您理解其运作机制。我将制作更详细的专题视频，并邀请律师参与展示各类协议及其运作方式。若您通过搜索查询，就能获得我未在此提供的多数信息。如有任何股权相关问题，欢迎在评论区留言。

How to sell your business? How to exit a company? I have done it a few times in my life. There are loads of different ways to do it. I'm going to share with you how to exit your business. Ultimately, selling a company is often a dream of a lot of entrepreneurs. I have done it a few times. I've done it a few different ways and I've got some interesting insights to share with you. One of the things I'll start off by saying: if you really want to sell your company, the best way to sell your company is not to want to sell it at all. The most amount of money I ever got for a company was because I didn't want to sell it. That's the strongest place to negotiate from. So the number one thing I want to tell you in an ironic twist when coming to sell your company: the best thing you can do is build a business you love, and selling it will accidentally happen. This has happened over and over again. History always repeats itself. Mark Zuckerberg was offered a billion dollars by Yahoo to sell his company and he said no. So now it's worth a trillion and I think there's something.

如何出售你的企业？如何退出公司？我一生中已经做过几次了。有很多不同的方法可以实现。我将与你分享如何退出你的企业。最终，出售公司通常是许多企业家的梦想。我已经做过几次了。我通过几种不同的方式完成过，并且有一些有趣的见解要与你分享。首先要说的是：如果你真的想出售你的公司，最好的方法就是根本不想出售它。我获得最高公司售价的原因正是因为我不愿意出售。这是最有利的谈判立场。所以，在出售公司时，我想告诉你的第一件事带着讽刺意味：你能做的最好的事情就是建立一个你热爱的企业，出售它会意外发生。这种情况一再发生。历史总是重演。雅虎曾出价十亿美元收购马克·扎克伯格的公司，他拒绝了。所以现在它价值万亿，我认为这其中有些道理。

and I think there's something really powerful in this process. It's kind of sales like I was teaching you earlier. It's kind of sales you don't want to sell. It means you can get the most for it. It's a very hard thing to actually be truly not interested in selling it if it is actually your goal, but it will ensure you get the maximum value out of a business if you do it this way. The other way to think about selling your business, and the way I've sold my last company, is I partnered up with a company that could buy my business. So Fluid partnered up with Price Waterhouse Cooper, and we worked on a project together. In that process of working on a project together, PWC realized that they should just buy us. Now at the time when it was first mentioned, I didn't want to sell - great negotiating first step - but in the end I did sell it, and I'll tell you all about that process in a minute. But I'm trying to highlight that another way to sell your business is partnership work with the company that is likely to want to buy your business.

我认为这个过程蕴含着强大的力量。就像我之前教你们的销售技巧一样，这是一种你不想卖的销售方式。这意味着你能获得最大价值。如果你的目标确实是出售，但又要真正对出售不感兴趣，这确实很难做到。但如果你这样做，就能确保从业务中获得最大价值。另一种考虑出售业务的方式，也是我出售上一家公司的方式，就是与可能收购你业务的公司建立合作关系。所以Fluid与普华永道建立了合作关系，我们一起合作了一个项目。在合作过程中，普华永道意识到他们应该直接收购我们。当第一次被提及时，我并不想出售——这是很好的谈判第一步——但最终我还是出售了，稍后我会详细讲述这个过程。但我想强调的是，出售业务的另一种方式就是与可能有意收购你业务的公司建立合作关系。

Build the relationship up and you'll be surprised how that can lead to an exit. Again, don't lean into it wanting an exit. Lean into it wanting to build a partnership that works for both parties, but it can be a great way to sell your business. The third way is to work with agents that actually sell businesses. There are a few. I'm not going to recommend any because this isn't a sponsored video by them, but you can Google them. There are many companies that do it. Sometimes it can be quite useful to get one of these companies to do it because, of course, if you're busy trying to sell your business, you're not busy growing your business. But I honestly feel like that these days these agents, there's a lot of them and they all have their own different agendas. So just make sure you do your due diligence. Ask the previous company that they work with what they were like. Make sure that the legal structure is very clear because you don't want to get conned by these companies when you come to the exit actual fee. The fourth way to sell your business is more

建立良好关系，你会惊讶地发现这最终可能促成企业退出。再次强调，不要单纯为了退出而接触。应该着眼于建立对双方都有利的合作伙伴关系，但这确实可以成为出售企业的绝佳方式。第三种方式是与真正从事企业出售的经纪人合作。市面上有不少这类机构。我不会特别推荐任何一家，因为这不是他们的赞助视频，但你可以通过搜索引擎找到它们。有很多公司提供这项服务。有时候聘请这类公司来处理会很有帮助，因为如果你忙于出售企业，自然就无法专注于业务发展。但说实话，如今这类经纪人数量众多，且各自有不同的议程。因此务必要做好尽职调查。向他们合作过的前一家公司了解其服务情况。确保法律结构非常明确，因为你不希望在最终支付费用时被这些公司欺骗。第四种出售企业的方式更为

The fourth way to sell your business is more a merger. Your competitor is a way to exit, and it might seem odd. You probably spent 10 years hating your competitor. I spent most of my early career making friends with my competitor. I originally thought I was going to sell Fluid to Ogie. I made a lot of friends at Ogave. I used to sit next to them at the awards dinner on purpose to connect to them. I did projects with them. I thought they were going to be the exit, but they weren't. I think mergers, however, are very common. Two businesses coming together that do the same thing is often the easiest way to sell a business. I will, however, caveat it with most of the time you don't get the most value. I sold my company Fluid to PWC. PWC are an accounts business, they're not a creative agency. So they saw more value in us than if I'd merged with Ogy that think they can do what we do. So sometimes selling to a non-competitor is more valuable. But if you want an easy sell, mergers often the way it works.

第四种出售企业的方式更像是合并。你的竞争对手是一种退出途径，这可能看起来有些奇怪。你可能花了十年时间讨厌你的竞争对手。而我早期职业生涯大部分时间都在与竞争对手交朋友。我原本以为我会把Fluid卖给Ogie。我在Ogave交了很多朋友。我过去常常特意在颁奖晚宴上坐在他们旁边与他们建立联系。我和他们合作项目。我以为他们会是我的退出途径，但结果并非如此。然而，我认为合并非常普遍。两家从事相同业务的企业合并通常是出售企业最简单的方式。不过我要提醒的是，大多数时候你无法获得最大价值。我把我的公司Fluid卖给了普华永道。普华永道是会计业务，他们不是创意机构。所以他们比那些认为自己能做得和我们一样的Ogy更看重我们的价值。因此，有时出售给非竞争对手更有价值。但如果你想要轻松出售，合并通常是可行的方式。

and it's not always true that you don't get the true total value. I've just from experience learned that sometimes selling outside the industry, like I did with Fluid to PWC, can lead to more money than selling to someone in the industry like Olgy, but that doesn't mean it's always true. Finally, if you want to sell your business, one of the things that you can also think about is allowing the management in your company to buy it. I have also done this. I let the leadership team at Nest buy that business, and there's many different ways to structure a buyout over time percentage of profit. But in the end, it can be a really good way allowing you to sell your business without that business getting hurt, and by also giving the people that worked in the company a chance to really step up and own what they've been building with you. I personally really was happy to sell Nest to my team, and I think it's a really powerful way of building an exit strategy for yourself while at the same time giving the people that run it the love and success that they deserve.

并非总是无法获得真正总价值的情况。根据我的经验，有时跨行业出售——比如我将Fluid卖给普华永道——比卖给行业内公司如Olgy能获得更高收益，但这并非绝对真理。最后，若你想出售企业，还可考虑让公司管理层收购。我也曾这样做过，让Nest的领导团队收购了该业务。可以通过多种方式构建基于利润分期的收购方案。最终，这能让你在不损害企业的情况下完成出售，同时给予公司员工真正承担责任、拥有他们与你共同创建事业的机会。我个人非常乐意将Nest卖给团队，认为这是为自己构建退出策略的绝佳方式，同时让运营者获得应得的关爱与成功。

So they're the main ways now. I will add that when it comes to selling a business, the key thing like anything at the beginning when you're building the business, never ever pitch to an investor or yourself that you're building a company to sell it. In fact, I would argue if you're building a company to sell it, and I've seen this many times, be careful you might end up getting stuck with a business you don't love. Do not build a business to sell it. Do not pitch to investors that you're going to sell it. Build a business you love. Investors want to invest in that. Build a business you never want to sell. People want to buy a business like that. That's the key to being successful in business in my opinion. Do not build something you don't love. Do not build something that doesn't have purpose. If you got value from this video, I'd really appreciate it by you asking a comment down below or even telling me what I've missed out in this video that you want in the future so I can make it for you.

这些是当前的主要方式。我想补充的是，在出售企业时，关键在于创业初期永远不要向投资者或自己宣称你创办公司是为了出售它。事实上，我认为如果你为了出售而创办公司——这种情况我见过很多次——要小心最终可能会被困在自己不喜欢的业务中。不要为了出售而创办企业。不要向投资者宣传你打算出售它。创办你热爱的企业。投资者愿意投资这样的企业。创办你永远不想出售的企业。人们想要购买这样的企业。在我看来，这是商业成功的关键。不要创建你不喜欢的东西。不要创建没有目标的东西。如果你从这个视频中获得了价值，我会非常感激你在下方留言提问，甚至告诉我这个视频中遗漏了你未来想看的内容，这样我就能为你制作相关内容。
