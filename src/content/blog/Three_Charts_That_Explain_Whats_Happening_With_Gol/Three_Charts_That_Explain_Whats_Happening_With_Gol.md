The price of gold is closing above $4,000, reaching heights it has never seen. The price of gold hit $4,000 a troy ounce for the first time, the most ever. And this rally has been unusual compared to anything else we've seen at least since 1979. When the going gets rough, people turn to gold. Here are three charts to help explain what's happening. The first chart is the price of gold futures. Futures prices have risen some 50% this year, which has outpaced many of the biggest crises in American history. Investors pile into gold for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, it tends to retain its value. Then during times of inflation, when the dollar could depreciate over the course of time, gold can maintain some of investors' value when dollars are actually becoming weaker.

黄金价格突破4000美元大关，创下历史新高。黄金价格首次达到每盎司4000美元，创下历史最高纪录。与至少自1979年以来我们所见的任何其他行情相比，这次上涨都显得非同寻常。当形势变得艰难时，人们就会转向黄金。以下三个图表有助于解释当前情况。第一张图表显示的是黄金期货价格。今年期货价格上涨了约50%，超过了美国历史上许多重大危机期间的涨幅。投资者涌入黄金市场有几个原因。首要原因是黄金往往能保值。其次在通胀时期，当美元可能随时间推移贬值时，黄金能在美元实际走弱时保持投资者的部分价值。

And if you look at some of those previous run-ups, there were financial meltdowns that helped explain why investors flocked to gold. In 1979, for example, there was an inflationary shock. In 2020, obviously, the global pandemic really upended people's economic expectations. This time around, things are different. On the one hand, we have this AI craze stock market that's at records. On the other hand, there's a lot of concern about policy dysfunction in Washington. There's runaway deficits, there's a government shutdown, and there's apparent lack of concern of longer for higher inflation in the US economy. You can see this with President Trump's push for lower interest rates. So if you zoom into gold prices this year, they first ramped up in the first part of Trump's second term. Then something odd happened. There was a basic stagnation in the gold market over the course of the summer. Things settled down, until August.

回顾之前的几次黄金上涨行情，都有助于解释投资者为何涌向黄金的金融危机。例如1979年出现了通胀冲击。2020年，全球疫情显然彻底颠覆了人们的经济预期。而这次情况有所不同。一方面，我们见证了创纪录的人工智能热潮推动股市。另一方面，人们对华盛顿的政策失灵存在诸多担忧。存在失控的财政赤字、政府停摆，以及美国经济中对长期高通胀明显缺乏关注的现象。从特朗普总统推动降低利率就能看出这一点。因此聚焦今年金价走势，在特朗普第二任期初期首先出现上涨。随后发生了奇怪的现象。整个夏季黄金市场基本处于停滞状态。局势在8月前保持平稳。

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a speech, essentially signaling that the Central Bank would begin cutting interest rates despite above target inflation. The baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance. Since then, gold prices have been off to the races. That brings us to chart two, which shows us how much central banks have added to their gold reserves. Central banks since the great financial crisis have really snapped up gold bullion, and they've done this in part because of a lot of doubts of the global financial system, which is really interwoven in many ways with the US economy, the US banks, and also the US Federal Reserve. So central banks around the world keep a variety of reserve assets on hand in order to shore up their financial systems.

美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔发表讲话，实质上表明尽管通胀高于目标水平，央行仍将开始降息。基准前景和风险平衡的变化可能需要对我们的政策立场进行调整。此后，黄金价格一路飙升。这让我们看到第二张图表，它显示了各国央行增加了多少黄金储备。自金融危机以来，各国央行确实在大举购入金条，部分原因是对全球金融体系的诸多疑虑——该体系在许多方面与美国经济、美国银行以及美联储紧密交织。因此世界各国央行会持有多种储备资产以巩固其金融体系。

For decades, the most common reserve asset has been the US dollar, which is sort of the gold standard, pardon the pun, for some of these reserve assets. As we can see further into the chart, they're continuing to buy gold now, and many of the biggest banks on Wall Street believe that central banks will continue to buy gold next year, continuing to support gold prices. Our final chart looks at the performance of the US dollar over the past year. And as you can see, it hasn't been very strong. By one measure, the US dollar had its weakest first half in the last 50 years. Now, it's important to start by understanding that the Trump administration, in some respects, wants a weaker US dollar. A weaker US dollar helps US exporters send their products abroad. But at the same time, additional factors have been weighing down the value of the US dollar against other currencies.

几十年来，最常见的储备资产一直是美元，这可以说是储备资产中的黄金标准——请原谅我用了这个双关语。从图表中我们可以进一步看到，各国央行现在仍在继续购买黄金，而华尔街许多大型银行认为央行明年将继续购买黄金，持续支撑金价。我们的最后一张图表展示了美元过去一年的表现。正如您所见，美元走势并不强劲。从某种衡量标准来看，美元经历了过去50年来最疲软的上半年表现。首先需要理解的是，特朗普政府在某些方面希望美元走弱。美元贬值有助于美国出口商将产品销往海外。但与此同时，其他因素也在压低美元相对于其他货币的价值。

First and foremost is a lack of confidence in the outlook for the US economy. This really proliferated around the Liberation Day tariffs in April, where there's a lot of uncertainty about the outlook for the US economy and inflation. And more recently, after Trump's Big Beautiful Bill passed Congress, there's been mounting concerns about long-term deficits around the United States, and how the US government will finance them through debt. With any boom, there's oftentimes a bust to follow that. In 1979, for example, a lot of the real price gains in gold evaporated within the next couple of years. So even though we have prices in gold now going vertical, some investors are kind of tapping the brakes on this narrative. US institutions have held up before.

首要原因是对美国经济前景缺乏信心。这一问题在四月的解放日关税期间尤为突出，当时对美国经济前景和通胀存在诸多不确定性。最近，在特朗普的《宏伟法案》通过国会后，人们对美国长期赤字以及政府如何通过债务为其融资的担忧日益加剧。任何繁荣之后往往伴随着萧条。例如在1979年，黄金的实际价格涨幅在随后几年内大幅蒸发。因此尽管当前金价直线飙升，部分投资者仍对这一趋势持谨慎态度。美国机构此前曾成功抵御过危机。

So if they hold up now, if the Fed remains independent, if inflation does come down, if US growth is able to continue, that could be a negative downside pressure on gold prices.

因此，如果当前形势得以维持，如果美联储保持独立性，如果通胀确实下降，如果美国经济增长能够持续，这可能会对金价构成负面下行压力。
