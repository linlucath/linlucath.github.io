All right, good afternoon. Today's guest speaker is Emmett Shear, who is the CEO of Twitch. Hello. Twitch was acquired by Amazon, where he now works. Emmett is going to do a new format of class today and talk about how to do great user interviews. So this is the talking to users part of starting a startup, which should be really useful. Thank you very much for coming. Thanks Tim.

好的，下午好。今天的特邀演讲者是 Emmett Shear，他是 Twitch 的首席执行官。你好。Twitch 已被亚马逊收购，他现在就在亚马逊工作。Emmett 今天将采用一种新的课堂形式，讨论如何进行出色的用户访谈。所以这是创业过程中与用户交流的部分，应该会非常有用。非常感谢你的到来。谢谢 Tim。

So, we kept working on Justin.TV for a while and we actually achieved a good deal of success, because it turned out that there were people out there who wanted to do the same thing we did, which was broadcast ourselves live on the Internet. But the issue with Justin.TV, the thing that kept us from achieving greatness, is we hadn't figured out yet how to build towards anything beyond that initial TV show. We knew how to build a great product actually. If you wanted to run a live 24/7 reality TV show about your life, we had the website for you. We had exactly what you needed. But if we wanted to go do more than that, if we wanted to open it up to a broader number of people, a broader spectrum of people, a broader use cases, we didn't have the insight to figure that out because we weren't that user. And so at some point we decided to pivot Justin.TV. We decided we needed to go in a new direction. We thought we'd built a lot of valuable technology but hadn't identified the use case that would let it get really big. And there were two directions that seemed promising. One of them was mobile, and one of them is gaming. And I led the gaming initiative inside of the company. And what we did with gaming that was very very different from what we'd ever done before was we actually went and talked to users, because while I loved watching gaming video, I was very aware that neither I nor anyone else in the company knew about broadcasting video games. And so I would amp up the content, I thought there was a market there, that was sort of the insight that I had which wasn't common at the time, which was how much fun it was to watch video games. Quick show of hands, people know about watching video game on the internet here? Okay, I'm just going to assume that people listening to this also know about it. If you don't know about watching video games on the internet, you should go read about that, because it's sort of an important context for the stuff I'm going to talk about. But the main point is I thought that was awesome but I didn't know anything about the side of it that was really important, which is actually acquiring the content to start broadcasting. So we went out, and we ran a very large number of user interviews. We talked to a lot of people and brought that data back, and that formed the core of all of the decision-making that was for the next three years of product features on Twitch was sort of some of the insights we got from that. And we continued to talk to users, and in fact built an entire part of the company whose job it is basically to talk to our users.

我们继续在 Justin.TV 上工作了一段时间，实际上取得了相当大的成功，因为事实证明确实有人想做和我们一样的事情，就是在互联网上直播自己。但 Justin.TV 的问题，阻碍我们取得更大成就的地方，是我们还没有想清楚如何在那最初的电视节目基础上进一步发展。实际上我们知道如何打造一个优秀的产品。如果你想运营一个关于自己生活的 24/7 真人秀电视节目，我们正好有适合你的网站。我们完全拥有你所需要的。但如果我们想要做得更多，如果我们想向更广泛的人群、更多样化的用户群体、更丰富的使用场景开放，我们缺乏洞察力来解决这个问题，因为我们不是那样的用户。所以在某个时刻，我们决定对 Justin.TV 进行转型。我们决定需要朝着新的方向发展。我们认为我们已经构建了很多有价值的技术，但还没有找到能让它真正发展壮大的应用场景。有两个方向看起来很有前景。一个是移动领域，另一个是游戏领域。我在公司内部领导了游戏计划。我们在游戏方面所做的与以往截然不同的是，我们真正走出去与用户交流，因为虽然我喜欢观看游戏视频，但我很清楚我和公司里的其他人都对直播游戏一无所知。所以我会加强内容，我认为那里有市场，这是我当时的见解，在当时并不常见，那就是观看游戏视频是多么有趣。快速举手示意一下，这里有人知道在互联网上观看游戏吗？好吧，我就假设听这个的人也都知道。如果你不知道在互联网上观看游戏，你应该去了解一下，因为这对我将要谈论的内容来说是一个重要的背景。但重点是，我认为这很棒，但我对其真正重要的方面一无所知，也就是实际获取内容开始直播。所以我们走出去，进行了大量的用户访谈。我们与很多人交谈，带回了这些数据，这形成了接下来三年 Twitch 产品功能所有决策的核心，其中一些见解就是我们从那里获得的。我们继续与用户交流，实际上建立了公司的整个部门，其工作基本上就是与我们的用户交流。

Which is a whole division that we just didn't even have at JustinTV. We had no one at the company whose job it was to talk to our most important users. So that was Twitch. I want to give you guys a little bit of insight into Twitch, what that meant going to talk to users. We determined that the broadcasters are the most important people. The reason we determined that was when we went and looked into the market, we looked into what determined why people watched a certain streamer or went to a certain website. They would just follow the content, right? You had a piece of content you loved and the broadcaster would come with you. That's actually the one really important point about user interviews, which is that who you talk to is as important as what questions you ask and you pull away from it. Because if you go and talk to a set of users, if we'd gone and talked to viewers only, we would have a completely different set of feedback than talking to the broadcasters. Talking to the broadcasters gave us insight into how to build a platform for them. There isn't a recipe for figuring out who the target user is for your product and who your target user should be. It comes down to thinking really hard and using your judgement to figure out who you're really building this for.

这是一个我们在 JustinTV 时根本没有的完整部门。公司里没有人负责与我们最重要的用户沟通。这就是 Twitch 的由来。我想让大家对 Twitch 有更深入的了解，了解与用户交流的意义。我们认定主播是最重要的人群。我们得出这个结论的原因是，当我们研究市场时，我们探究了是什么决定了人们观看特定主播或访问特定网站。他们只是追随内容，对吧？你有一个喜欢的内容，主播就会随之而来。这实际上是用户访谈中非常重要的一个点：你与谁交谈和你提出的问题以及从中获取的信息同样重要。因为如果你去和一组用户交谈，如果我们只和观众交谈，我们会得到与和主播交谈完全不同的反馈。与主播交流让我们深入了解如何为他们构建平台。并没有一个确定产品目标用户是谁以及目标用户应该是谁的固定方法。这归根结底需要深入思考，运用你的判断力来确定你真正在为谁构建这个产品。

So what I want to do is something a little bit interactive now. I've got a bunch of ideas from you guys actually, sort of suggested ideas. I'm going to pick one of them. I want everyone to sit down and do step one of this process for me right now, which is think about who would you go ask about this, like which people, where would you go to find the people you needed to talk to about this in order to learn about what you should build. And so the idea you're going to use is a lecture focused note taking app. The idea is I don't think that the state of the art for note taking is good enough yet, and I want to make a note taking app that improves that experience, makes taking notes in class better or taking notes by listening to a lecture online better. Maybe it has collaboration features, maybe it helps you focus better somehow, it has multimedia enhancements. I don't know, right? All sorts of possible features, but that's the idea. So take 120 seconds right now and think about not what you would ask or what the right features for this app is, but who would you talk to? Who should give you that feedback that's going to tell you whether this is good or not? I actually mean it right now. Take your laptop out, type, write some stuff down. Think about it, it's good enough to think of that in your head, but actually if you just write it down and come up with the ideas.

现在我想做一些互动性的内容。实际上我从你们那里收集了很多建议性的想法。我会从中挑选一个。我希望大家现在坐下来，为我完成这个过程的第一步：思考你会去咨询谁，比如哪些人，你会去哪里找到需要与之讨论这个问题的人，以便了解你应该构建什么。你们要使用的想法是一个专注于讲座的笔记应用。我认为目前笔记记录的技术水平还不够好，我想开发一个能够改善这种体验的笔记应用，让课堂记笔记或在线听讲座记笔记变得更好。也许它具备协作功能，也许它能以某种方式帮助你更好地集中注意力，或者有多媒体增强功能。我不确定，对吧？有各种可能的功能，但这就是基本想法。所以现在花 120 秒，不要思考你会问什么或这个应用应该有哪些正确功能，而是思考你会与谁交流？谁应该给你反馈，告诉你这个想法是否可行？我是认真的，现在就做。拿出你的笔记本电脑，打字，写下一些内容。思考一下，在脑海中思考就足够了，但如果你真的写下来并想出这些想法会更好。

So what I want to do is something a little bit interactive now. We're going to talk about the five types of people you talk to, and who you think the most important one was. Like, actually do it. Because there's nothing like actually running through a practice of something and trying to do it to actually get into your head the right way to do it. I'm gratified to see the clicking of keyboards now. If you're following along at home, pause, actually do it. Think about who you would talk to. Because that's the first question for almost any startup that you need to answer: who is my user and where am I going to find them? Alright, that's way shorter than you normally used to think about this problem. It's actually a really tricky problem in figuring out where to source the people, which is pretty hard. We're going to move along anyway in this highly abbreviated version of learning how to build a product and run a user interview.

现在我想做一些互动性的内容。我们将讨论你与之交谈的五类人群，以及你认为其中最重要的一类是谁。就像，真正去做这件事。因为没有什么比实际演练和尝试更能让你真正掌握正确的做法。我很高兴听到现在键盘敲击的声音。如果你在家跟着学习，请暂停视频，真正去做这件事。思考你会与谁交谈。因为这是几乎所有初创企业都需要回答的第一个问题：我的用户是谁，我在哪里能找到他们？好的，这比你通常思考这个问题的时间要短得多。实际上，找到人员来源是一个非常棘手的问题，相当困难。在这个高度简化的学习如何构建产品和进行用户访谈的版本中，我们将继续推进。

One approach you might use would be College IT. Presumably for the most part, if you want to sell software to students, the people who need to be bought into that are usually the school administrators. So that would be one approach if you think that will work. You would presumably go talk to college students and find out they don't actually buy any note-taking software right now at all. It's possible they do, in which case I'm completely wrong and this is where you actually have to go talk to the users. But you then have to try maybe other groups. I would talk to college IT administrators as well. That's another area that's really promising. You might talk to parents who spend money on their kids' education and are willing to pull their wallet out. Parents of kids who are freshmen going off to college for the first time need this app to make your kid productive so that they don't fail out of college. I see a lot of groups that are potential, that aren't necessarily the obvious user, but who are critical to your app's success potentially. When you're at the very beginning of a startup like this, when you have this idea that you think is awesome, you want to have the broadest group you possibly can. You don't just want to talk to one type of person and learn that. You want to get familiar with

你们可能会采用的一种方法是面向高校 IT 部门。在很大程度上，如果你想向学生销售软件，通常需要获得学校管理人员的认可。如果你认为这方法可行，那将是一种途径。你可能会去和大学生交流，然后发现他们现在根本不购买任何笔记软件。也有可能他们确实会购买，那样的话我就完全错了，这时你就需要真正去和用户交流。但之后你可能需要尝试其他群体。我也会和高校 IT 管理人员交流。这是另一个非常有前景的领域。你可能会和那些愿意为子女教育花钱、愿意掏钱包的家长交流。那些第一次上大学的新生家长需要这个应用程序来让孩子提高效率，以免在大学里挂科。我看到很多潜在群体，他们不一定是明显的用户，但可能对你的应用程序成功至关重要。当你处于这样的创业初期，当你拥有这个你认为很棒的想法时，你希望尽可能覆盖最广泛的群体。你不仅仅想和一种类型的人交流并了解情况。你希望熟悉

You want to get familiar with the space. You want to get familiar with the various kinds of people who will be contributing. All right. So let's have somebody come up and we're going to pretend we're going to the senior interview. So we're going to talk to a college student and try to find out what we should build, what we should get into this note-taking app. So, another volunteer please for running an interview. Yes. All right, so hello. Hi, I'm Stephanie. Hi, Stephanie. Nice to meet you. Welcome, thank you for agreeing to do this user interview with us. So I wanted to hear from you about what are your note-taking habits. How do you take notes today? Sure, so I take notes in a variety of ways. I like to now because of speed and efficiency and just to come back to it later, it's easier for me to just take notes on my laptop. And so a lot of those notes will be primarily text based. But in certain classes, for example, if I'm taking a History class, most of it will be in text. But if I'm taking a Physics class for example, they're going to be more complex diagrams, different angles that I have to draw and so that's little harder for me to get. What software do you use for this stuff today? I just do pen and paper for that. You do pen and paper, so you do a combination. You take notes with pen and paper, you take notes with your computer sometimes. Exactly. Yeah.

你需要熟悉这个空间。你需要熟悉将要参与贡献的各种人群。好的。那么让我们请人上来，我们将假装进行高级访谈。我们将与一名大学生交谈，试图找出我们应该开发什么，应该在这个笔记应用中包含什么功能。那么，请另一位志愿者来主持访谈。好的。那么，你好。你好，我是斯蒂芬妮。你好，斯蒂芬妮。很高兴认识你。欢迎，感谢你同意与我们进行这次用户访谈。我想了解你的记笔记习惯。你现在是如何记笔记的？当然，我以多种方式记笔记。现在由于速度和效率的原因，以及为了之后回顾方便，在笔记本电脑上记笔记对我来说更容易。所以很多笔记主要是基于文本的。但在某些课程中，例如，如果我上历史课，大部分内容都是文本。但如果我上物理课，例如，会有更复杂的图表，我需要绘制不同的角度，这对我来说更难处理。你现在使用什么软件来做这些事情？我直接用纸笔来做。你用纸笔，所以你采用组合方式。你有时用纸笔记笔记，有时用电脑记笔记。没错。是的。

And when you take all these notes, again it's like, do you actually review them? Like, be honest, do you actually go back and actually ever look at these notes? The pen and paper not so much. But yes to the software-based, because it's more easy to access and it's easier for me to share and collaborate and maybe even merge notes with classmates and friends.

当你记下所有这些笔记时，这又引出一个问题：你真的会复习这些笔记吗？说实话，你真的会回头去看这些笔记吗？纸质笔记不太会复习。但软件笔记确实会复习，因为它更容易访问，也更容易让我分享和协作，甚至可能与同学和朋友合并笔记。

So what do you use to take notes today on your computer? Google Docs and Evernote. Google Docs and Evernote? Tell me more about why you use two things at the same time. So Evernote is easy if I'm trying to just collect it for myself. And yes you can share, but I think Google Docs for me is easier to share and that depends also if a friend has already created a folder.

那么你现在在电脑上用什么记笔记？Google 文档和 Evernote。Google 文档和 Evernote？请详细说说为什么同时使用两种工具。如果我只是想为自己收集笔记，Evernote 很方便。虽然它也可以分享，但我觉得 Google 文档对我来说更容易分享，这也取决于朋友是否已经创建了文件夹。

For example on Google Docs and I just have to add to that folder if it's a group project versus if it's for my personal use I tend to go more toward Evernote. So it sounds like you do a lot of note-taking collaboration. I wish it was integrated. Tell me more about that. Do you want up taking most of the value of the notes out of notes other people take? Or is it mostly your own notes you review at the end of a semester?

例如在 Google 文档上，如果是小组项目，我只需要添加到那个文件夹；如果是个人使用，我倾向于使用 Evernote。听起来你做了很多笔记协作。我希望它们能整合在一起。请详细说说。你是从别人的笔记中获得大部分价值，还是在学期末主要复习自己的笔记？

How does that work? It's mostly mine because I'm pretty picky about the way I like things organized, like design wise, or formatting. Even color, I'm really particular with, and the font that we use.

这是如何运作的？主要是我自己的笔记，因为我对组织方式很挑剔，比如设计方面或格式。甚至颜色我也很讲究，还有我们使用的字体。

And when you take notes, that really affects the way I study. So, I tend to personalize it, even after I merge. You pull in notes from other people, but then you merge them into the main. What works for me. If you have Evernote notes and you have Google Docs notes and you have pen and paper notes, once the semester's over, do you ever go back to any of that stuff? For classes not so much, but if it's notes I've taken for talks like these, for example, or if it's like interview prep that I'm doing, I tend to go back because of things that I like to keep fresh in my mind and to help me prep for future things. So that's interesting. Tell more about that. Like you take notes not just in class? Yeah, so I take notes to also summarize main points. So if it's like inspirational quotes, for example talks that I go to like these, and then maybe I'm going to an event where I'm actually going to meet someone and it helps to actually think about and to remember and recall what we shared at the time that I attended the talk or something. Awesome. All right. Well, normally I'd actually dig into a lot more detail. There's a huge amount of open questions that are still in my mind after hearing that stuff.

当你做笔记时，这确实会影响我的学习方式。因此，即使在合并后，我也倾向于将其个性化。你会引入其他人的笔记，但随后将它们合并到主要内容中。这对我很有效。如果你有 Evernote 笔记、Google Docs 笔记以及纸笔笔记，学期结束后，你会回头查看任何这些内容吗？对于课程笔记不太会，但如果是像这样的讲座笔记，或者是我正在做的面试准备笔记，我倾向于回头查看，因为我想让某些内容在脑海中保持新鲜，并帮助我为未来的事情做准备。这很有趣。多谈谈这一点。比如你不仅在课堂上做笔记？是的，我也会通过做笔记来总结要点。比如励志名言，例如我参加的这类讲座，然后可能我要参加一个活动，实际上要见某人，这有助于真正思考和回忆我们当时在讲座或类似场合分享的内容。太棒了。好的。通常我会深入探讨更多细节。听完这些内容后，我脑海中仍然有大量开放性问题。

Questions about which people you collaborate with, questions about whether or not you like the volume of notes, and how long of note-taking stuff. Just sort of digging into what the current behavior is. But in interest of time and not keeping everyone here hearing about the intricacies of one person's note-taking habits forever, we're going to move on. But thank you very much Stephanie, that was appreciated. So that's the kind of stuff you notice - we're not talking about the actual content of the app at all. I'm not really interested in features. I don't really want to know about the specific feature set in Google Docs and Evernote. I might start digging in a little bit more into which features actually get used, like if she's actively collaborating and how that works. I heard some interesting things about using folders - that's interesting to me. But the main thing you're trying to do when you're running these first set of interviews is not necessarily get questions about user flows and optimizing that, or questions about the specifics of any of that stuff. It can be distracting because users think they know what they want. You get the horseless carriage effect, where you're getting asked for a faster horse instead of trying to design the actual real solution to the problem. If you start asking people about features, you want to stay as far away from features as possible.

关于你与哪些人合作的问题，关于你是否喜欢笔记数量以及笔记记录时长的问题。只是深入了解当前的行为模式。但为了节省时间，不让大家一直听一个人笔记习惯的细节，我们将继续前进。不过非常感谢斯蒂芬妮，这很有价值。这就是你注意到的那种情况——我们完全没有讨论应用程序的实际内容。我对功能并不真正感兴趣。我并不真正想知道 Google 文档和 Evernote 中的具体功能集。我可能会更深入地了解实际使用的功能，比如她是否积极协作以及如何运作。我听到了一些关于使用文件夹的有趣事情——这对我来说很有趣。但在进行这第一轮访谈时，你主要要做的不一定是获取关于用户流程和优化的问题，或者关于任何这些细节的具体问题。这可能会分散注意力，因为用户认为他们知道自己想要什么。你会遇到"无马车效应"，即人们要求更快的马，而不是试图设计出真正解决问题的方案。如果你开始询问人们关于功能的问题，你希望尽可能远离功能。

Because the things they tell you wind up feeling overwhelmingly real. When you have a real user asking you for a feature, it's very hard to say no to them. Because here's a real person who really has this problem, and they're saying build me this feature. But as you start to talk to lots of people and really get a sense for what their problems are, you figure out if this is actually a promising area or not. Based on what I heard there, starting from that interview, I'm not necessarily positive there is a problem or there's at least a big enough problem that it's worth building a whole new product for. Because I didn't hear a lot of things were a big blocker, or there was something really wrong with the way it was working. Unless I had some big idea I would take that as maybe a negative sign. But it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't move forward and keep talking to more people. Because just because you talk to the first person and you don't get anything out of it, doesn't mean there's not going to be a ton more people who actually have a problem. And once you talk to about six, seven, eight people you're usually about done. It's unlikely you're going to discover a bunch of new information there. Which is why it's important to talk to different extremes of people right. Go find people who are different points because this is just six or seven Stanford college students, you're going to get a very different response when we talk to six or seven high school students, or six or seven parents.

因为他们告诉你的事情最终会感觉无比真实。当有真实用户向你请求某个功能时，很难拒绝他们。因为这是一个真实存在的人，确实遇到了这个问题，他们要求你开发这个功能。但当你开始与许多人交谈并真正了解他们的问题所在时，你就能判断这是否确实是一个有前景的领域。根据我所听到的，从那次访谈开始，我并不确定存在问题，或者至少存在一个足够大的问题，值得为此开发一个全新的产品。因为我没有听到太多关于存在重大障碍的内容，或者运作方式存在严重问题。除非我有一些重大想法，否则我会将此视为负面信号。但这并不一定意味着你不能继续前进并与更多人交谈。因为仅仅因为与第一个人的交谈没有收获，并不意味着不会有更多真正遇到问题的人。一旦你与大约六、七、八个人交谈后，通常就差不多了。在那里不太可能发现大量新信息。这就是为什么与不同类型的人交谈很重要。去找处于不同立场的人，因为这仅仅是六七个斯坦福大学生，当我们与六七个高中生或六七个家长交谈时，你会得到非常不同的回应。

All right, one second, let me look at the source material. Based on that, I think it's possible you could come up with a set of ideas. You have this information about how someone takes notes. You've come up with potentially when you had this idea - you had some ideas as to how you could build something cool. If you're going to build just one feature on top of Google Docs, what would that feature be? For a new product like this, it might be a good way to get started thinking about where to go. They're extensively using these things right now. How can we make that experience just one quantum better? Something that would be really exciting to this person to be one step ahead. Let me take two minutes right now and think about what that feature might be. Try to come up with what you might do based on what you heard from Stephanie that could convince her to switch away from her current collaborative, multi-person, all-working-together workflow on Google Docs to your new thing that has all the features of Google Docs plus this one special thing that's going to make it more useful and convincing to stop using what they are using. Awesome, all right. I'm going to invite our third guest if you have something up.

好的，稍等片刻，让我查看一下原始材料。基于此，我认为你们有可能提出一系列想法。你们掌握了某人如何记笔记的信息。当你们产生这个想法时，你们可能已经对如何构建一些很酷的东西有了些想法。如果你们要在 Google 文档基础上只构建一个功能，那会是什么功能？对于这样的新产品，这可能是开始思考发展方向的好方法。他们现在正在广泛使用这些工具。我们如何能让这种体验实现质的飞跃？设计出能让用户感到兴奋、领先一步的功能。现在给我两分钟时间，思考一下这个功能可能是什么。尝试根据你们从斯蒂芬妮那里听到的信息，构思出能够说服她放弃目前在 Google 文档上使用的协作式、多人共同工作流程的方案，转向你们的新产品——这个产品具备 Google 文档的所有功能，再加上一个特殊功能，使其更加实用，并能说服用户停止使用现有工具。太好了，好的。如果你们准备好了，我将邀请我们的第三位嘉宾。

So, I'm going to invite our third guest, if you have something up. I don't want to put you on the spot if you feel like you're not sure. What I thought about was the reason she uses Everknow is like sticky note type notes, like more thoughts and details. I feel like Google Docs has documents and not smaller notes. So, I feel like a feature that would be like a mobile version of draw it that isn't clunky and doesn't make you make real documents could be really useful. That's a good insight. That's exactly what you get out of that user interview. You've got this user-fed feedback and this idea. What if we had a Google Docs that had the collaborative aspects and group aspects, but where you could pull in more little one-off notes and it was designed more around note taking. Now, once you have this idea, which I think is actually probably a reasonable approach, is this enough? Is this something people would actually switch just to have? There are two ways to validate that. One is if you're quick at programming, you can literally just go build it and throw it out in the world to see what happens. When that works, that's an excellent way to approach it. But a lot of the time, that one little thing that's just a little bit better might take you three months to actually build something worthy of using.

那么，我要邀请我们的第三位嘉宾，如果你有什么想法的话。如果你觉得不确定，我不想让你为难。我想到的是她使用 Everknow 的原因就像是便签式的笔记，更像是想法和细节的记录。我觉得 Google Docs 有文档功能，但没有小型笔记功能。所以我认为一个类似移动版绘图功能、不那么笨重且不需要创建正式文档的功能可能会非常有用。这是个很好的见解。这正是你从用户访谈中得到的东西。你获得了用户反馈和这个想法。如果我们有一个具备协作功能和团队功能的 Google Docs，但你可以添加更多零散的笔记，并且它更专注于笔记记录呢？现在，一旦你有了这个想法，我认为这实际上可能是一个合理的方法，这足够吗？人们真的会为此而转换使用吗？有两种验证方法。一是如果你编程速度快，你可以直接去构建它，然后发布到世界上看看会发生什么。当这种方法有效时，这是一个极好的处理方式。但很多时候，那个只是稍微好一点的小功能可能需要你花三个月时间才能真正构建出值得使用的东西。

And so, you actually want to go out and validate that idea further before you go ahead and start building it. And so, you might take that idea, and you might go back out and sit down with diagrams. You can draw what it looks like, draw the work flow, and bring that in front of people. But the one thing you really don't want to do is ask them this, this is sort of a trap, and I just want to warn you against doing it. Just don't go out and say, to come up with a feature idea, and go out and ask people, "I've got this great idea for a feature. Are you excited about it?" Because the feedback you get from users, if you tell them about a feature and ask them, "Is this feature good?" It's often, "Oh yeah, that's great. That sounds like such a good idea." But when you actually take that in front of people, and you actually build it, you then find out that while they thought it was such a clever idea, no one actually cares to switch to get it. And so, the one question you can't ask is, "Is this feature actually good or not?"

因此，在实际开始构建之前，你确实需要走出去进一步验证这个想法。你可以带着这个想法，带着图表回去。你可以绘制它的外观，绘制工作流程，然后将其展示在人们面前。但你真正不想做的是问他们这个问题，这有点像是一个陷阱，我想提醒你不要这样做。不要走出去说，想出一个功能创意，然后去问人们："我有一个很棒的功能创意，你们对此感到兴奋吗？"因为如果你告诉用户一个功能并问他们："这个功能好吗？"你得到的反馈往往是："哦，是的，太棒了。这听起来是个好主意。"但当你真正将其展示给人们，并实际构建它时，你会发现虽然他们认为这是一个聪明的想法，但实际上没有人愿意转换去使用它。因此，你不能问的问题是："这个功能到底好不好？"

Yes, Sam? Together, right? If your idea is to build something on top of Google Docs, don't for your V1 go rebuild an awesome Google Documents, but for note taking application. Find a way to write a browser extension that stuffs just that little bit of incremental feature in, and see if it's actually useful for people. Go, like actually, go find a way to cheat is what it comes down to, because if you can't actually put it in front of people, it's really, really hard to find that out. For bigger things, where you're actually trying to get people to spend money, it actually gets a lot easier. So, if you're selling it, it's great actually. Sales is this cure all for this problem. Get people to put, give you their credit card and I guarantee you they're actually using the feature. It's one of the most validating thing you can do for a product, is go out there and actually get them to commit to pay you up front. And the problem is when you're working on a student note taking app, that's going to be relatively hard because you probably unless your idea is that you're actually going to sell it. It's probably something where you're thinking at least the trial version's free, and you're not necessarily going to learn that much by trying to charge people money. But if you go out there and you can get people to say hey I'm going to give you money? The money test is amazing, it really does clarify whether or not they're really excited, because if you're not five-dollars-excited about it, you're probably not very excited about it.

是的，Sam？一起做，对吧？如果你的想法是在 Google 文档之上构建某些功能，不要在你的 V1 版本中重建一个很棒的 Google 文档，而是针对笔记应用。想办法编写一个浏览器扩展，只需添加那一点点增量功能，然后看看它是否真的对人们有用。实际上，就是要找到一种"作弊"的方法，因为如果你不能真正把它摆在人们面前，真的很难发现这一点。对于更重要的事情，当你真正试图让人们花钱时，实际上会变得容易得多。所以，如果你在销售它，这实际上很棒。销售是解决这个问题的万能药。让人们提供他们的信用卡，我向你保证他们实际上正在使用这个功能。这是你能为产品做的最具验证性的事情之一，就是走出去，真正让他们承诺预先付款。问题是当你开发一个学生笔记应用时，这会相对困难，因为除非你的想法是真正要销售它。这可能是一个你认为至少试用版是免费的，通过试图向人们收费你不一定能学到太多东西的情况。但如果你走出去，能让人们说"嘿，我要给你钱"？金钱测试非常神奇，它确实能澄清他们是否真的兴奋，因为如果你对它没有五美元的兴奋度，你可能对它并不太兴奋。

So, the last thing I wanted to do was actually work through with you guys what happened at Twitch. So I brought some slides of feedback that I would like to get put up. It's my only slides for the thing, and it's representative excerpts of Twitch feedback. I had a whole 26-page document full of all the feedback. And then, I realized that reading that was going to be a little bit tedious and there was no way I'd make it through it in a lecture. So, pretend that this stuff is all representative of lots of people sending this kind of thing out to ask me questions. And, I've already pre-condensed it for you into the real feedback you got.

所以，我最后想做的就是和你们一起梳理 Twitch 发生的事情。我带来了一些反馈的幻灯片，希望能展示出来。这是我为这件事准备的唯一幻灯片，它是 Twitch 反馈的代表性摘录。我有一份完整的 26 页文档，包含了所有的反馈。然后，我意识到阅读这些内容会有些乏味，而且我不可能在一次讲座中完成。所以，请假装这些内容代表了很多人发出的这类问题。而且，我已经为你们预先将其浓缩成了你们得到的真实反馈。

When we were working on Twitch to go launch it, we wouldn't talk too much about existing Justin.tv broadcasters and asked them about their experience broadcasting, what they liked about broadcasting, why they broadcasted, what they broadcasted, what else was going on in their life. And, the interesting thing is when you talk to users of your product who are detailed users of your product, they come back to you with actually very detailed things about features. Because they actually get mired in the feature and you have to sort of read between the lines.

当我们为推出 Twitch 而工作时，我们不会过多谈论现有的 Justin.tv 主播，而是询问他们的直播经历、喜欢直播的原因、为何直播、直播内容以及生活中的其他情况。有趣的是，当你与产品的深度用户交流时，他们会向你反馈非常详细的功能相关事项。因为他们实际上陷入了功能细节中，你必须从字里行间解读含义。

But they asked for first things like I want to be able to clear the banlist in my chat room. That was actually a very common request because there was a particular issue with how our chat rooms worked. People had asked for the ability to edit the titles of highlights after creating them. And, this stuff was really consistent.

但他们首先要求的是诸如"我希望能够清除聊天室中的封禁名单"这样的功能。这实际上是一个非常常见的请求，因为我们的聊天室运作方式存在特定问题。人们要求在创建精彩片段后能够编辑其标题。而且，这些反馈内容非常一致。

As we talked to broadcasters, you probably talked to 12, 14, something like that broadcasters from the Justin.tv gaming platform. We got all this feedback. What else do we have? We have your competitors have all these cool features like polls and scrolling text. I can personalize chat there, and so we have some positive feedback. They're like, oh, you guys don't have ads, that's great. I need to be able to ban. So, a bunch of stuff around chat. A bunch of stuff around interactivity with their viewers. And that was all really interesting. So, this was what the Justin TV broadcasters wanted us to build. And this is what they felt pain using the product. And so, if you thought that what we did was going to address these problems, you would be wrong. Because, actually, people who are using your service already and are willing to put up with all these issues kind of means that these are probably not actually the biggest problems. Because if you're willing to ignore the fact that you can't edit the band lesson, titles are uneditable, and there's no way to get trolls out of your channel, and you're using the service anyways, maybe those aren't huge problems. And so, that sort of brings up another really important point. Which is, you have to compare groups of people, and compare the level at which they argued with us. So, if you go to the next slide, yes. Nice. We got competitor broadcaster feedback, which is really interesting.

当我们与主播们交流时，你可能与来自 Justin.tv 游戏平台的 12、14 位左右的主播进行了对话。我们获得了所有这些反馈。我们还有什么？你们的竞争对手拥有所有这些酷炫功能，比如投票和滚动文字。我可以在那里个性化聊天，所以我们得到了一些积极反馈。他们说，哦，你们没有广告，这很棒。我需要能够封禁用户。所以，有很多关于聊天功能的需求。有很多关于与观众互动的需求。这些都很有意思。这就是 Justin TV 主播希望我们构建的功能。这是他们在使用产品时感到痛苦的地方。因此，如果你认为我们的做法能够解决这些问题，那你就错了。因为实际上，已经在使用你们服务并愿意容忍所有这些问题的用户，某种程度上意味着这些可能并不是真正最大的问题。因为如果你愿意忽略无法编辑封禁课程、标题不可编辑、无法将网络喷子赶出频道这些事实，却仍然使用该服务，也许这些问题并不严重。这就引出了另一个非常重要的观点。你必须比较不同人群，比较他们与我们争论的程度。所以，如果你翻到下一页，是的。很好。我们获得了竞争对手主播的反馈，这非常有趣。

We heard a lot from people who are using other broadcast platforms. They wanted to be able to switch multiple people onto their channel at the same time. They complained about us not having a rev share program or they talked a lot about how they're trying to make a living. They really wanted to make money pursuing this gaming broadcasting thing. And, they talked a lot about video stability. Our service wasn't good in Europe specifically but, but just globally, video stability is this huge, huge issue for them. And if you compare and contrast actually, it was really different. Like, the things that people who didn't use our service said about what they cared about, was completely different from the things that people who were using the service cared about. And we focused on this stuff because this was the stuff where, it was so bad that they weren't even willing to use our service because of it. And most of them actually had thought about this because we were, our user base happened to be a very well educated user base in the area who knew about all their options for, for this. And, they would, they actually, you know, reaching out to them meant they could, they probably already tried all four services and actually had an opinion. It's great when you can users who are that, that informed and that, that, they have understand the space that well.

我们听到了很多来自其他广播平台用户的反馈。他们希望能够同时将多人切换到他们的频道上。他们抱怨我们没有收入分成计划，或者他们多次谈到他们如何试图谋生。他们确实想通过从事游戏直播这件事来赚钱。而且，他们多次谈到视频稳定性问题。我们的服务在欧洲尤其不佳，但就全球范围而言，视频稳定性对他们来说是一个极其重要的问题。实际上，如果你进行比较和对比，情况确实非常不同。比如，不使用我们服务的人所关心的内容，与使用我们服务的人所关心的内容完全不同。我们关注这些问题，因为这些问题严重到他们甚至因此不愿意使用我们的服务。他们中的大多数人实际上已经考虑过这个问题，因为我们的用户群体恰好是该领域受过良好教育的用户，他们了解所有可选择的方案。联系他们意味着他们可能已经尝试了所有四种服务，并且确实有自己的看法。当你能接触到如此了解情况、对领域有如此深刻理解的用户时，这真是太棒了。

You have to compare. So, this is really important stuff that we talked about with non-broadcasters. We went up there and talked to all the people who weren't using us or competitors. In many ways, those are the most important people, right? Talking to your competitors is your short term win. Someone using a competing piece of software, unless your competing software is something like Google which is a search engine that everyone uses. Then there are no non-users to convert. But in the case of gaming broadcasting, almost everyone is a non-user. The majority - this is true for most new products - the majority of people you're competing with are non-users. They are people who have never used your service before. What they say is actually the most important. What they say is the thing that blocks you from expanding the size of the market with your features. If all you do is look at your competitors and yourself, and all you do is talk to people who use your competitors' products or people who use your products, you can never expand. Well, not never, but you're not learning the things that help you expand the size of the market. You want to talk to people who aren't even trying to use one of these things yet, who have thought about it maybe, but who aren't into it. So what did they say? My computer isn't fast enough. I'm focused on training 12 hours a day for the next tournament. I like making the perfect video and editing it, so I just upload things to YouTube.

你必须进行比较。所以，我们与非广播用户讨论的内容非常重要。我们去那里与所有不使用我们或竞争对手产品的人进行了交流。在很多方面，这些人是最重要的，对吧？与竞争对手交流是你的短期胜利。有人使用竞争软件，除非你的竞争软件像谷歌这样每个人都在使用的搜索引擎。那样就没有非用户可以转化了。但在游戏直播领域，几乎每个人都是非用户。大多数情况下——这对大多数新产品来说都是如此——你竞争的对象大多数是非用户。他们是以前从未使用过你服务的人。他们说的话实际上是最重要的。他们所说的内容正是阻碍你通过功能扩展市场规模的因素。如果你所做的只是关注竞争对手和自己，只与使用竞争对手产品的人或使用你产品的人交流，你永远无法扩展。好吧，不是永远，但你学不到帮助你扩大市场规模的东西。你需要与那些甚至还没有尝试使用这类产品的人交流，那些可能考虑过但对此不感兴趣的人。那么他们说了什么？我的电脑速度不够快。我专注于为下一场比赛每天训练 12 小时。我喜欢制作完美的视频并进行编辑，所以我只是把内容上传到 YouTube。

You have to compare, but I don't do live streaming. I have no desire to go into that space. This is actually a big problem, particularly in Korea. Once our strategy gets broadcast in a major tournament, we have to start over. We have to come up with an entirely new strategy. The last thing we'd ever want to do would be broadcast our practice sessions. That's going to hurt us in the next big tournament. This became a big outreach program for us, trying to figure out how we can get people over this. We bought people computers. We worked really closely with gaming broadcast software companies to help make the broadcasting software better. We started building broadcasting into games and into platforms. We built broadcasting into the Xbox and into the Playstation 4 because we needed to overcome this issue that broadcasting was too hard and wasn't possible. For us, these are three big groups we looked at for broadcasting. When you combine that feedback, what it tells you is not the features to build. The features they asked for were things like polls and the ability to have child accounts. We haven't built most of that stuff, but what was important were the issues and the goals they were trying to accomplish. People wanted money. People wanted stability and quality.

你必须进行比较，但我不做直播。我没有进入那个领域的意愿。这实际上是一个大问题，尤其是在韩国。一旦我们的策略在重大赛事中被直播，我们就必须重新开始。我们必须想出全新的策略。我们最不愿意做的事情就是直播我们的训练过程。这会在下一场重大赛事中损害我们的利益。这成为了我们的一项大型推广计划，试图找出如何帮助人们克服这个问题。我们为人们购买了电脑。我们与游戏直播软件公司密切合作，帮助改进直播软件。我们开始将直播功能内置到游戏和平台中。我们将直播功能内置到 Xbox 和 Playstation 4 中，因为我们需要克服直播太难和不可行的问题。对我们来说，这是我们关注的三个主要直播群体。当你综合这些反馈时，它告诉你的不是要构建哪些功能。他们要求的功能包括投票和子账户功能等。我们大部分都没有构建这些功能，但重要的是他们试图解决的问题和实现的目标。人们想要金钱。人们想要稳定性和质量。

We, the people, wanted universal access for viewers all around the world to be able to watch them. And so that became our focus, actually. And we dumped almost all of our resources into things that none, no one ever mentioned in an interview. But those are the things that actually address the problem. And the way you could tell that it worked was as we would build these things, and then we would go back to this exact same people we interviewed and say hey, you told us you really cared a lot about making money. Well, we built you this subscription program that will let you make money. And it's astonishing because most people aren't, have never had that experience, actually. They've never talked to someone and said it would be really great if your product had feature X. And then, like, two months later or a month later, your product actually has feature X, or at the very least, a feature that addresses the problem they brought up. And so it was actually the people we converted first to our product are the people that we talk to about user research. They are the ones who were actually the most impressed, which is kind of fun. But it really worked, because those we picked people who are representative. We picked big broadcasters, small ones, medium ones. And we made sure we were addressing their concerns. And that was completely different from how we'd approach the problem on JustinTV. Because in JustinTV, when we'd try to do this, we'd sat down. We trolled through huge amounts of data. Like we spent tons of time looking at Google Analytics, looking at mixed panel, looking at in-house analytics tools.

我们人民希望为世界各地的观众提供普遍访问，让他们能够观看这些内容。实际上，这成为了我们的重点。我们将几乎所有资源投入到那些在访谈中从未有人提及的事情上。但正是这些事情真正解决了问题。你能看出这种方法有效的方式是：当我们构建这些东西后，我们会回到采访过的同一批人那里说，嘿，你告诉我们你非常关心赚钱。那么，我们为你建立了这个订阅计划，它将让你赚钱。这确实令人惊讶，因为大多数人实际上从未有过这样的体验。他们从未与某人交谈过，说如果你的产品有 X 功能会很棒。然后，比如两个月后或一个月后，你的产品确实有了 X 功能，或者至少有一个功能解决了他们提出的问题。实际上，最先转换使用我们产品的人正是我们进行用户研究时交谈的人。他们是最印象深刻的人，这很有趣。但这确实有效，因为我们选择了具有代表性的人。我们选择了大型广播公司、小型公司和中等规模的公司。我们确保解决了他们的关切。这与我们在 JustinTV 上处理问题的方式完全不同。因为在 JustinTV 上，当我们尝试这样做时，我们会坐下来。我们筛选了大量数据。比如我们花了大量时间查看 Google Analytics，查看混合面板，查看内部分析工具。

Figuring out how people use the service. Looking at where our traffic came from. Completion rates on flows. We spent all this time doing that. And that's good, I mean, you can learn things from that. I'm not telling you not to look at your data. But it doesn't tell you where you need to go. It doesn't tell you where, what the problems are you need to address. And so we would just sort of invent these ideas in JustinTV. And then, nine times out of ten, without talking to someone, the idea turns out to be bad. And that's just one of those disappointing things about doing user interviews and user feedback. It's why, I think, so many people don't do it, which is, you're going to get negative news about your favorite pet feature most of the time. Like, you're going to have this great idea, and you're going to talk to the user, and it's going to turn out that nobody actually wants that. Like no, no one's actually, they're actually completely concerned about completely different things and they don't care about what you thought was important at all. And that's a little bit sad but just, just think about how sad you'd be in four months when you launched that feature and it turns out no one actually wants to use it. So think that's about it for my lecture section of what we're talking about. I want to take some questions from the audience.

了解人们如何使用这项服务。查看我们的流量来源。流程完成率。我们花了所有时间做这些事情。这很好，我的意思是，你可以从中学习到一些东西。我不是告诉你不要看你的数据。但它不会告诉你需要去哪里。它不会告诉你需要解决的问题在哪里，是什么。因此我们在 JustinTV 中只是凭空想出这些主意。然后，十有八九，在没有与人交流的情况下，这些想法最终被证明是糟糕的。这只是进行用户访谈和收集用户反馈时令人失望的事情之一。我认为这就是为什么很多人不这么做的原因，因为大多数时候你会得到关于你最喜欢的宠物功能的负面消息。比如，你有了一个很棒的想法，然后你去和用户交流，结果发现实际上没有人想要那个功能。不，实际上没有人，他们实际上完全关心完全不同的事情，他们根本不在乎你认为重要的东西。这有点令人难过，但想想看，四个月后当你推出那个功能却发现实际上没有人想使用时，你会多么难过。所以我想这就是我讲座部分的内容。我想从观众那里回答一些问题。

What do startups get most wrong about? When telling them about a feature, you want to learn about what's already in their heads. You want to avoid putting things there. The other thing is asking about your pet feature direction. If you think you want to add subscriptions to your product, going and asking people "would you pay for a subscription" or "would you use this feature" is a mistake. The other big mistake people make is talking to who's available rather than talking to who they need to talk to. There are certain users that are really easy to get at because they are members of your forum already. You talk to the users on that forum because they're easier to get access to. We spent weeks digging for identity information and figuring out who these people were so we could contact them and talk to them. Because a lot of these people weren't obvious - they were just some user on a site. If that site didn't support messaging, there was no obvious way to interact with them. We spent a bunch of time trying to network and find those users and bring them on. If you just talk to who's easy to talk to, you're not really getting the best data. The fortunate side is that almost everyone is flattered to be asked what they think, and most of them will actually talk to you and tell you things.

初创公司最容易犯什么错误？当你向他们介绍某个功能时，你应该了解他们头脑中已有的想法，而不是强行灌输新概念。另一个错误是询问他们偏爱的功能方向。比如你想在产品中添加订阅功能，直接问人们"你会为订阅付费吗"或"你会使用这个功能吗"是错误的做法。人们常犯的另一个大错误是与容易接触的人交谈，而不是与需要接触的人交谈。有些用户非常容易接触，因为他们已经是论坛成员。你与论坛用户交流是因为他们更容易接触到。我们花了数周时间挖掘身份信息，弄清楚这些人是谁，这样我们才能联系他们并与他们交谈。因为很多这样的人并不明显——他们只是网站上的某个用户。如果那个网站不支持消息功能，就没有明显的方式与他们互动。我们花了很多时间尝试建立联系网络，寻找这些用户并邀请他们参与。如果你只与容易交谈的人交流，你实际上无法获得最好的数据。幸运的是，几乎每个人都因被询问意见而感到荣幸，他们大多数人实际上会与你交谈并告诉你他们的想法。

Since you mentioned recording, did you try to insist on doing Skype interviews rather than over email? Things you learn in interviews come from the interesting moments. When they say something you didn't expect or didn't already know, you should drop into detective mode. Detective mode is recognizing "huh, that's interesting" and asking "can you tell me more about that?" People don't like silence, so they'll keep talking to fill the void. The best part about doing it over Skype or in person is you have that interactive feedback, and you can actually pull a lot more out of people. Email interviews are okay, but they're basically useless. If you're in person or over Skype, they're actually also easy to record. Make sure you ask them if it's okay to record it. It's not polite to record people without their consent. But if they're willing to give you a user interview, they're probably willing for you to record it as well.

既然你提到录音，你是否尝试坚持使用 Skype 面试而非邮件沟通？面试中的收获往往来自那些有趣的时刻。当他们说出你未曾预料或不知晓的内容时，你应该立即进入侦探模式。侦探模式就是意识到"嗯，这很有趣"并追问"能详细说说吗？"人们不喜欢沉默，因此他们会不断说话来填补空白。通过 Skype 或面对面交流的最大优势在于你能获得即时互动反馈，从而能挖掘出更多信息。邮件访谈尚可接受，但基本上毫无用处。如果是面对面或 Skype 交流，实际上也便于录音。务必事先征得对方同意，未经许可录音是不礼貌的。但如果对方愿意接受用户访谈，他们通常也会同意录音。

We've tried to address that by finding representative people in those countries who speak both English and Korean, and reaching out to them. But the problem with that is you're not actually getting a representative sample no matter how hard you try. The very fact that they are a fluent English speaker means they're not representative of all the people who don't speak fluent English. It's just a hard problem. It's why companies find it easier to build markets in their home country much more easily than abroad, because it's really hard to talk to users abroad.

我们试图通过寻找那些国家中既会说英语又会说韩语的具有代表性的人，并与他们联系来解决这个问题。但问题在于，无论你多么努力，实际上都无法获得具有代表性的样本。他们能说流利英语这一事实本身就意味着他们不能代表所有不会说流利英语的人。这确实是个难题。这就是为什么公司发现在本国建立市场比在国外容易得多，因为与国外用户沟通确实很困难。

Hiring people who speak, exchange business cards, or whatever it is you actually do now isn't business cards. And you get in touch with them. We tended not to compensate people. I think that if people don't care enough about the problem to talk to someone who's trying to solve it, you're probably barking up the wrong tree. We never had any trouble getting people to talk to us about paying them.

雇佣会说某种语言的人、交换名片或你现在实际做的任何事情都不是真正的业务。你与他们取得联系。我们倾向于不给人们报酬。我认为如果人们对问题不够关心，不愿意与试图解决问题的人交谈，那你可能找错了方向。我们从未在让人们与我们谈论报酬方面遇到任何困难。

What about on site user feedback tools? Do you get a little feedback from that? So there's this whole second set of user feedback that's really important that I should talk about. The question was, what about on site user feedback tools? And I think this stuff you're talking about is where you have a new product and you want to see how, if it's actually going to work or not. And so you put it in front of people and you see how they use it or not. That's really important. That kind of work is super important and it can tell you lots of things about where you went wrong building something before you launch it, which is great. It doesn't tell you what to build. It helps you iron out the kinks and edges of the thing you did build. But generally speaking, that wasn't the kind of user feedback we were getting. I mean that stuff is good, it's good, it's much more similar to the data driven approach. Right? You're finding out why are people dropping off in this flow, you're not finding out what problems should I really be solving for them, and what do they care about as a human.

那么现场用户反馈工具呢？你能从中获得一些反馈吗？所以还有这整个第二类用户反馈非常重要，我应该谈谈。问题是，现场用户反馈工具怎么样？我认为你谈论的这些是指当你有一个新产品，你想看看它是否真的能正常工作。所以你把它放在人们面前，观察他们如何使用或不使用它。这真的很重要。这类工作非常重要，它可以告诉你在发布产品之前构建过程中哪里出了问题，这很棒。但它不会告诉你应该构建什么。它帮助你完善你已经构建的东西的缺陷和边缘。但总的来说，这不是我们获得的那种用户反馈。我的意思是那些东西很好，它很好，它更类似于数据驱动的方法。对吧？你发现人们为什么在这个流程中流失，你并没有发现我应该真正为他们解决什么问题，以及作为人类他们关心什么。

For this kind of really early stage user interview that's crucial for startups to do, that's where you want to focus. We didn't bring people on site actually, almost all over phone or Skype. For the three different groups of people, there are different kinds of feedback. So as a startup with limited time and resources, is that a good area to focus on first? With the three different kinds of people, we focused on one of them given that we had very limited resources. We focused on the people using competing products because we knew that they already were interested in the behavior that we needed and they were willing to do it at all. Therefore all we had to do is convince them to switch, which is a much easier thing to do than to try to create new behavior where none existed before. We had to do that because we had to get some quick wins, because my gaming project inside of Justin.tv would have been killed if it wasn't showing 25% month over month growth every single month. So we did, and that meant focusing on short term to get the people in right now. That turned out to be good in general because it turns out that building something that some people want generally generalizes and so I want to bring in people who weren't even users of the service as well. Twitch has been around from the beginning so it filled up, for example the video game industry. In the beginning this industry was very decentralized, like there wasn't a lot of cohesion with different video game.

对于初创公司至关重要的这类早期用户访谈，这正是你需要关注的重点。我们实际上并没有邀请人们到现场，几乎都是通过电话或 Skype 进行。对于这三类不同的人群，会得到不同类型的反馈。那么作为时间和资源有限的初创公司，这是首先应该关注的好领域吗？面对这三类不同的人群，考虑到我们资源非常有限，我们专注于其中一类。我们专注于使用竞争产品的用户，因为我们知道他们已经对我们需要的行为感兴趣，并且他们完全愿意这样做。因此，我们只需要说服他们转换，这比试图在完全没有基础的情况下创造新行为要容易得多。我们必须这样做是因为我们需要快速取得一些成功，因为我在 Justin.tv 内部的游戏项目如果每个月不能实现 25%的环比增长就会被取消。所以我们这样做了，这意味着专注于短期目标，立即吸引用户。这总体上被证明是好的，因为事实证明，构建一些人想要的东西通常具有普适性，所以我也想吸引那些甚至不是服务用户的人。Twitch 从一开始就存在，所以它填补了，例如视频游戏行业的空白。起初这个行业非常分散，不同的视频游戏之间缺乏凝聚力。

Different video game companies are consolidating where tournaments are held and related matters. But now it's very different. So you said originally you spoke to broadcasters and streamers themselves. How does that change when, for example, Riot has banned users or professional players from streaming their own stuff? Have you tried to gain leverage with that?

不同的电子游戏公司正在整合比赛举办地点和相关事务。但现在情况已经大不相同。你说最初是与广播公司和主播本人沟通。那么当例如 Riot 禁止用户或职业选手直播自己的内容时，这种情况会如何改变？你是否尝试过借此获得影响力？

The game publisher interviews in general demonstrate that the pool of people you care about is going to shift over time. The people who get you started, like the crucial people to get your product started for the first six months, are not who will be using it three years later. It's very important you keep doing this stuff because one thing that's really easy to do is to do a little bit of it in the beginning, achieve some level of success, and then you sort of stop talking to new people. That's a good way to make the next set of features you build be not as good as the first ones.

游戏发行商的访谈通常表明，你所关心的用户群体将随时间推移而发生变化。那些帮助你起步的人，比如产品最初六个月至关重要的用户，通常不会在三年后继续使用它。持续进行用户访谈非常重要，因为人们很容易在初期做一些访谈，取得一定成功后，就逐渐停止与新用户交流。这将导致你后续开发的功能不如最初的功能优秀。

How do you give good user feedback if you're a user? It's a really good question. I think what I want a user to do is to tell me about what they're really thinking and what their problems really are, and to just sort of ramble. I want someone to just tell me about stuff in their life because the more you learn about them as a person, and the context of what they're doing, the easier it is to understand why they want the things they want. That's really the critical question.

作为用户，如何提供良好的用户反馈？这是个非常好的问题。我认为我希望用户做的是告诉我他们真实的想法和他们真正面临的问题，并且能够自由地畅谈。我希望有人能告诉我他们生活中的事情，因为你越了解他们作为个体的情况以及他们行为的情境，就越容易理解他们为什么需要某些东西。这确实是关键问题。

What I'm looking for in someone when I'm doing a user interview is someone who is going to be willing to talk a lot and be willing to really give me a full picture. So that's what, I guess on the flip side, if you want to be a good, if you want to help people out with good user interview.

我在进行用户访谈时寻找的是那些愿意畅所欲言，并且能够提供完整画面的人。所以，反过来想，如果你想成为一个好的，如果你想通过良好的用户访谈帮助他人。

If you want to be a good interviewer, if you want to help people out with good user interview feedback, just talk about stuff and everything. All right, great. Well, thank you very much.

如果你想成为一名优秀的访谈者，如果你想通过良好的用户访谈反馈来帮助他人，只需谈论各种话题即可。好的，很棒。非常感谢。
