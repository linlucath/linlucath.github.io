Part two of Culture and Team, and we have Ben Silverman, the founder of Pinterest, and John and Patrick Collison, the founders of Stripe. Founders that have obviously some of the best in the world at thinking about culture and how they build teams. So, there's three areas that we're gonna cover today. One will just be sort of general thoughts on culture as a follow up to the last lecture. And then we're really gonna dig into what happens at the founding of these companies and building out the early team. And then how that changes and evolves as these guys have scaled their companies up to 100 plus. I don't even know how many people you have now, but quite a lot. Very large organizations and how you adapt these principles of culture. But to start off I just wanna ask a very open-ended question which is, what are the core pieces of culture that you found to be most important in building out your companies?

文化与团队第二部分，我们有Pinterest创始人本·西尔弗曼，以及Stripe创始人约翰·科里森和帕特里克·科里森。这些创始人显然在思考文化和团队建设方面堪称世界顶尖。今天我们将讨论三个领域。首先是作为上节课后续的文化总体思考。然后我们将深入探讨这些公司创立初期的情况和早期团队建设。接着是随着这些公司将规模扩大到100人以上时，文化如何变化和发展。我甚至不知道你们现在有多少员工，但相当多。在大型组织中如何调整这些文化原则。但首先我想问一个开放式问题：在构建公司过程中，你们发现哪些文化核心要素最为重要？

So what are the most important parts? Yeah I mean I think for us, we think about on a few dimensions. One is who do we hire, and what do those people value? Two is what do we do every day, like why do we do it? Three is what do we choose to communicate? And then I think the fourth is what we choose to celebrate. I guess the converse of that is what you choose to punish. But in general I think running a company based on what you celebrate is more exciting than what you punish. But I think those four things kind of make up the bulk of it for us.

那么最重要的部分是什么？我认为我们是从几个维度来考虑的。一是我们招聘什么样的人，这些人重视什么？二是我们每天做什么，为什么要做？三是我们选择沟通什么？然后我认为第四是我们选择庆祝什么。我想相反的就是选择惩罚什么。但总的来说，我认为基于庆祝内容来运营公司比基于惩罚内容更令人振奋。我认为这四个方面构成了我们文化的主体。

We've placed a large emphasis on, as Stripe has grown and probably more than other companies is, transparency internally. And I think it's been something that's been really valuable for Stripe, and also a little bit misunderstood. All the things people talk about like hiring really great people, or giving them a huge amount of leverage. Transparency for us plays into that. We think that, if you are aligned at a high level about what Stripe is doing, if everyone really believes in the mission.

随着Stripe的发展，我们比其他公司更强调内部透明度。我认为这对Stripe来说一直是非常宝贵的，但也有些被误解。人们谈论的所有事情，比如招聘优秀人才，或给予他们巨大影响力。透明度在这方面发挥着作用。我们认为，如果大家对Stripe正在做的事情有高度共识，如果每个人都真正相信这个使命。

And yeah that's super important. And again, it manifests itself in a bunch of different ways. Like for example, in hiring, I think a large part of the reason why maybe the first ten people you hire, what kind of goes to ship, decisions are so important is because you're not just hiring those first ten people. You're actually kind of hiring 100 people. Because you should think of each one of those people as bringing along sort of another ten people with them, and sort of figuring out exactly what 90 people, you would like those first ten people to bring along is obviously gonna be quite consequential for your company. But really briefly I think it's largely about sort of abstraction.

是的，这非常重要。而且，它会以多种不同的方式体现出来。比如在招聘方面，我认为你最初招聘的十个人之所以如此重要，很大程度上是因为你不仅仅是在招聘这最初的十个人。实际上你相当于在招聘一百个人。因为你应该把每个人都看作是带来了另外十个人，而弄清楚你希望这最初的十个人带来哪九十个人，显然对你的公司会产生重大影响。但简单来说，我认为这主要涉及抽象思维。

So one thing that a lot of speakers in this class have touched on is how hiring those first ten employees, if you don't get that right, the company basically will never recover but no one has talked about how to do that so. What have the three of you looked for when you've hired these initial employees, to get the culture of the company right? How, how have you found them, and what have you looked for?

这门课程中很多演讲者都提到的一点是，如果最初招聘的十名员工没有选对，公司基本上就无法恢复，但没有人讨论过具体该怎么做。你们三位在招聘这些初期员工时，为了建立正确的公司文化，都关注哪些方面？你们是如何找到他们的，又看重哪些特质？

Sure. So, I guess this answer is different for every company and I'll say for us it was very inductive. So I literally looked for people that I wanted to work with and that I thought were talented. I think, I've read all these books about culture, because when I don't know how to do something, I first go read things and everyone has all these frameworks. And I think one bit, big misconception that someone said once is that people think culture is like architecture when it's a lot more like gardening. You know, you plant some seeds and then you pull out weeds that aren't working, and they sort of expand. So, when we first hired people we hired people that were like ourselves. I often looked at like three or four different things that I really valued in people. You know, I looked for people that worked hard and seemed high integrity and low ego. I looked for people that were creative.

当然。我认为这个问题的答案因公司而异，对我们来说，这是一个非常归纳的过程。我实际上就是寻找我想与之共事并且我认为有才华的人。我读过很多关于文化的书籍，因为当我不知道该怎么做时，我首先会去阅读，每个人都有各种框架。我认为有人曾经说过的一个重大误解是，人们认为文化像是建筑，但实际上它更像是园艺。你知道，你种下一些种子，然后拔掉那些不合适的杂草，它们会逐渐扩展。所以，当我们最初招聘时，我们招聘的是与我们相似的人。我通常会关注三四个我真正看重的特质。我寻找工作努力、诚信度高且不自负的人。我寻找有创造力的人。

I looked for people that were creative, and I usually meant that they were really curious. They had all these different interests. Some of our first employees are probably some of the quirkiest people I've ever met. They were engineers but they also have all these crazy hobbies. Like one guy made his own board game with this elaborate set of rules. Another guy was really into magic tricks. And he had coded not only like this magic trick on the iPhone, but he had shot the production video with a preview. And I think that, that quirkiness has actually been a little bit of a calling card. And we find that really creative, quirky people that are excited about many disciplines, and are extraordinary at one tend to build really great products. They tend to be great at collaborating.

我寻找有创造力的人，通常我指的是那些真正充满好奇心的人。他们有着各种各样的兴趣爱好。我们最早的一些员工可能是我见过的最古怪的人。他们是工程师，但同时也有着各种疯狂的爱好。比如有个人自己制作了棋盘游戏，还配有一套复杂的规则。另一个人则非常痴迷魔术。他不仅编写了iPhone上的魔术程序，还拍摄了带有预览的制作视频。我认为这种古怪特质实际上成了一种名片。我们发现，那些真正有创造力、古怪、对多个领域都充满热情，并在某一领域出类拔萃的人，往往能打造出非常出色的产品。他们通常也很擅长合作。

Then the last thing is, we really look for people that wanted to, they just wanted to build something great, and they weren't arrogant about it, but they just felt like, it'd be really cool to take a risk and build something bigger than themselves. And that, in the beginning, is very, very easy to select for if you're in our situation. We had this horrible office, like, nobody got paid. So there was no external reason, other than being excited about building something to join. In fact, there was every reason not to. And that's something, looking back, I really, really value, because we always knew people were joining for the purest reasons, and in fact, were willing to forgo other great job opportunities, market salary, a clean office, good equipment just for the chance to work.

最后一点是，我们真正寻找的是那些想要创造伟大事物的人，他们并不傲慢，只是觉得冒险去创造比自己更伟大的东西真的很酷。在我们当时的情况下，这一点在初期非常容易筛选。我们的办公室很糟糕，而且没人领工资。所以除了对创造事物的热情之外，没有任何外部理由加入。事实上，有各种理由不加入。回首往事，我真的很珍视这一点，因为我们一直知道人们是出于最纯粹的理由加入的，事实上，他们愿意放弃其他好的工作机会、市场水平的薪水、干净的办公室、良好的设备，只为获得工作的机会。

So, to this day I think a lot of those traits have been seeded and are embedded in the folks that we look at now. Yeah the first ten hires are really hard because you're making these first ten hires at a point where no one's heard of this company, no one really wants to work for it. You're just these, like two weird people working on this weird idea. And like their friends are telling them not to join.

所以，直到今天，我认为这些特质已经在我们现在寻找的人身上生根发芽。前十个员工确实很难招聘，因为在你招聘这前十个人时，没有人听说过这家公司，没有人真正想为它工作。你们就像是两个怪人在研究一个奇怪的想法。而且他们的朋友都劝他们不要加入。

For our second employee, I think he'd accepted the offer or he was just about to, and his best friends took him out the night before, and it was like a full on assault for why you should not join this company, why this is ruining your life basically. And so anyway the guy subsequently continued to join. And actually one of those friends also now works at Stripe. But this is what you're up against.

对于我们的第二名员工，我认为他已经接受了录用通知或者即将接受，而他最好的朋友们在前一天晚上带他出去，对他进行了一番猛烈抨击，告诉他为什么不应该加入这家公司，基本上就是说这会毁掉他的生活。但无论如何，这个人最终还是加入了。实际上，那些朋友中现在也有人在Stripe工作。但这就是你们要面对的情况。

You probably shouldn't look to hire your brilliant friends at Facebook and Google or whatever, because they're already discovered. If they're wanting to join that's great, but they're probably harder to convince.

John and I spent a little while yesterday afternoon trying to figure out in retrospect what kind of traits our first ten or so people had in common that we thought were significant. In general, when speaking about culture, I want to caveat everything we say with the fact that this sort of advice is based on very limited experience and widely over extrapolated. I think there's a lot of truth to that.

But for our particular first ten people, the things we figured out that seemed to be important were that they were also very genuine and straight. I think that actually matters quite a lot in that they're people that others want to work with, that they're people that others trust. They have an intellectual honesty in how they approach problems and so forth.

They were people who really liked getting things finished. There's a lot of people who are really excited about tons of things, but only a subset of those are actually excited about completing things.

There's a lot of talk about hiring people off their GitHub resumes, but I actually think that doesn't quite ring correct to me. In the sense that there's a large premium on lots of different things, I think it's actually a priori much more interesting to work with someone who has spent two years really investing in going deep in a particular area.

The third trait they all seem to have in common is they just cared a great deal. It was offensive to them when something was just a little bit off. In hindsight, there are all these crazy things we used to do that in fact seem crazy like we probably shouldn't have done them, but everyone was always borderline insane in how much they cared about tiny details.

你不应该指望从Facebook、谷歌或其他大公司招聘你那些才华横溢的朋友，因为他们已经被发掘过了。如果他们主动想加入当然很好，但说服他们可能更加困难。

昨天下午，约翰和我花了一些时间回顾思考，我们最初招聘的十个人有哪些共同特质是我们认为很重要的。总的来说，在讨论文化时，我想对我们所说的一切都加上免责声明——这类建议基于非常有限的经验，且被过度推广泛化了。我认为这种说法很有道理。

但对我们特定的前十名员工来说，我们发现重要的特质是他们都非常真诚和正直。我认为这一点实际上非常重要，因为他们是别人愿意共事的人，是别人信任的人。他们在处理问题等方面具有学术诚信。

他们是真正喜欢完成工作的人。有很多人对各种事情都充满热情，但其中只有一部分人真正对完成工作感到兴奋。

关于根据GitHub简历招聘的讨论很多，但我认为这种做法并不完全正确。从某种意义上说，不同方面都有很高的要求，我认为与那些花两年时间真正投入并深入研究某个特定领域的人共事，从理论上讲实际上更有意义。

他们似乎都具备的第三个特质是他们都极其认真负责。当事情稍有偏差时，他们会感到很不舒服。回想起来，我们过去做过很多现在看来很疯狂的事情，可能本不该那么做，但每个人在关心微小细节方面都近乎偏执。

Like we used to, like every single API request that ever generated an error went to all of our inboxes and phoned all of us. Because it seems terrible to ever have an error that didn't go and get a resolution from the user standpoint. Or we used to like copy everyone else on every outgoing email. And we'd like point out slight grammar or spelling mistakes to each other, because it's terrible to ever send an email with a spelling mistake.
就像我们过去那样，每一个产生错误的API请求都会发送到我们所有人的收件箱，并给我们所有人打电话。因为从用户的角度来看，出现错误却没有得到解决似乎很糟糕。或者我们过去喜欢在每封外发邮件中抄送其他人。而且我们喜欢互相指出轻微的语法或拼写错误，因为发送带有拼写错误的邮件是很糟糕的。

I look back at our first few folks that we hired. They came from all over the place. Like I put up ads on Craigslist. I went to random tech talks. We used to throw weekly barbeques at the office. It was like bring your own food and drinks. And then we would just talk to folks. I think every time I ever went and got coffee in Palo Alto, like one of you guys was recruiting at Coopa because their office was like strategically situated next to the best coffee shop.
我回顾我们最初雇佣的那几个人。他们来自各行各业。比如我在Craigslist上发布广告。我去参加随机的技术讲座。我们过去常在办公室举办每周烧烤聚会。就像是自带食物和饮料。然后我们就和人们聊天。我想每次我去帕洛阿尔托喝咖啡时，就像你们有人在Coopa招聘一样，因为他们的办公室就像是战略性地设在最好的咖啡店旁边。

But I think that the really good people generally, they're generally doing something else, and so you have to go seek them out, rather than expecting that they're gonna seek you out. Triple so, when no one's ever heard of or is using the product that you're working on.
但我认为真正优秀的人通常都在做其他事情，所以你必须主动去寻找他们，而不是期望他们会来找你。当没有人听说过或正在使用你正在开发的产品时，这一点尤其重要。

It's probably really important to have a great elevator pitch. Not even for investors, but just because everyone you run into right now is maybe six months, a year down the road, a potential recruit. And so, the right time to have gotten them excited about your company, the right time for them to have started following us, and be thinking about it if they think about what they're going to do next, is as soon as you can start.
拥有一个出色的电梯演讲可能非常重要。不仅是为了投资者，更是因为你现在遇到的每个人可能在六个月、一年后成为潜在的招聘对象。所以，让他们对你的公司感到兴奋的最佳时机，让他们开始关注我们并在考虑下一步行动时思考加入我们的最佳时机，就是尽可能早地开始。

It's gonna take a very long time to recruit people so being able to consistently get people excited about what you're doing will pay back dividends later.
招聘人员需要很长时间，因此能够持续让人们对你所做的事情感到兴奋将在以后带来回报。

So anyway those were the three traits. Maybe this is a little tangential, but John and I were also chatting yesterday afternoon. A bunch of our friends have started companies right out of school. We were thinking about what seems to go wrong in those companies. I think something that may be the most common failure mode is doing something overly niche, or overly specific and banded. I think maybe it comes from a major shift in time horizon as you go from classes to building a start-up. A class plays out in a quarter or a semester, whereas a start-up is like a five or ten year thing. This is really problematic because it's actually quite hard to hire people for niche things. If you tell somebody you're going to build a rocket that goes to Mars, that sounds almost impossible but also sounds awesome, so it's actually pretty easy to convince people to work on it. But if you pick something pretty narrow that inductively comes out of the kinds of problems you solve as part of a class project, that's actually a much harder effort.

总之，这就是那三个特质。可能有点跑题，但约翰和我昨天下午也在聊天。我们很多朋友都是一毕业就创业了。我们在思考这些公司通常会出什么问题。我认为最常见的失败模式可能是选择了过于小众、过于具体和局限的领域。我想这可能源于从课堂学习到创业的时间跨度发生了重大转变。一门课程通常持续一个季度或一个学期，而创业则像是五到十年的事情。这确实很有问题，因为为小众项目招聘人员实际上相当困难。如果你告诉别人你要造一艘去火星的火箭，这听起来几乎不可能，但也很酷，所以说服人们参与其实很容易。但如果你选择的是从课堂项目问题中归纳出来的相当狭窄的领域，那实际上要困难得多。

One specific question that has come up a lot is: how as a relatively inexperienced founder do you identify who the really great people are? You meet people at barbecues or through friends, and maybe you've worked with them a little bit. What specifically did you guys do in your processes to identify when this person is going to be really great? Or when did you really get it wrong? What have you learned about how to identify raw talent if you can't just say they worked at Google or Facebook so they must be good?

一个经常被提及的具体问题是：作为相对缺乏经验的创始人，你如何识别真正优秀的人才？你在烧烤聚会或通过朋友认识一些人，可能和他们有过一些合作。在你们的筛选过程中，具体采取了哪些方法来识别某人是否真的会很优秀？或者你们什么时候判断失误过？如果无法仅凭他们在谷歌或脸书工作过就断定他们一定优秀，你们学到了哪些识别原始才能的方法？

Well, I mean, you'll never 100% know obviously until you work with folks.

嗯，我的意思是，显然在与他们共事之前，你永远无法百分之百确定。

Which is why the flip side of it is, if someone you hired just wasn't a good fit, you owe it to the company and to them to tell them how they can improve, and if they're not working out to fire them. But I think that generally, the question of talent falls into two big buckets. Like, one is you have some sense of what makes them good at their job, and there are some areas where you have taste in that area, and there's some where you don't. And the ones where you don't are actually much more difficult. So what we would do is we would do a few things. Like first, before talking to anyone we try to get a sense for what is really world class in that discipline mean. And this becomes very important later, when you're hiring things like Head of Finance and you don't know anything about finance, except what was contained in a library book you got about an introduction to finance, or head of marketing. So, I always made it a habit of talking to people that I knew de facto were world class and then asking them specifically, what are the key traits or characteristics that you look for? What are the questions that you ask, and how do you find them? And if you're looking for the next person that's as good as you, where is that person working right now, and what's her phone number? I think that learning what good and bad is during the interview process is extremely expensive. It's an expensive use of your time, and it's an expensive use of everyone else's time, so precalibration of that really matters. And then, once you have someone in the interview process, you'll build the process over time to both screen quality. And so at Pinterest, we have an evolving set of standard questions that we're always rotating through, and we're always measuring, are these good indicators or bad indicators of quality?

这就是为什么反过来说，如果你雇佣的人不合适，你有责任告诉公司和他们如何改进，如果他们表现不佳就要解雇他们。但我认为一般来说，人才问题可以分为两大类。比如，一类是你对他们擅长工作的原因有所了解，有些领域你在这方面有判断力，有些领域则没有。而那些你没有判断力的领域实际上要困难得多。所以我们会做几件事情。比如首先，在与任何人交谈之前，我们试图了解该领域真正世界级水平意味着什么。这在后来变得非常重要，当你招聘财务主管时，你对财务一无所知，除了从图书馆借的财务入门书籍中了解的内容，或者营销主管。因此，我总是习惯于与那些我已知实际上是世界级水平的人交谈，然后具体询问他们：你寻找的关键特质或特征是什么？你问什么问题，以及如何找到他们？如果你正在寻找下一个和你一样优秀的人，那个人现在在哪里工作，她的电话号码是多少？我认为在面试过程中学习什么是好什么是坏是非常昂贵的。这是对你时间的昂贵使用，也是对其他人时间的昂贵使用，因此事先校准这一点真的很重要。然后，一旦有人进入面试流程，你会随着时间的推移建立流程来筛选质量。在Pinterest，我们有一套不断发展的标准问题，我们总是在轮换使用，并且总是在衡量这些问题是质量的好指标还是坏指标？

But the other thing that the questions are meant to do is they're supposed to give a sense for whether this is the right place for that person to come and work. This relates to the point you made about being very transparent about what's going to be easy or hard. Really great people want to do things that are hard; they want to solve tough problems. There was a certain brilliance in Google setting out these interview questions that were thought to be really difficult, because then people who like solving really difficult problems come out and seek those opportunities.

I think it's really important, even as companies get bigger, that you don't whitewash the risks. I heard that at PayPal, after interviewing with people like Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, they would say that Visa and MasterCard want to kill them, and they might be doing something that's illegal. But if you succeed, you'll redefine payments. Or when they were recruiting for iPhone, they didn't even tell people what they were doing. They said you won't see your families for three years, but when you're done, your kid's kids will remember what you built.

I think that's a really good thing in recruiting as well - that you're very transparent about why you think it's an amazing opportunity, but you lay out in gory detail why it's going to be hard. Then the right people select in, or they select out of that opportunity.

Evidence suggests it's worth a lot for people to see their kids, though. I feel like one thing you have to do as you try to identify talent is have the confidence to interview in a way that works for you. If you're not the world's best engineer and you're trying to interview engineering candidates, it's tempting to try to color code what everyone else does - get them to code on whiteboard and do other engineering interviewee things. In the case of Stripe, when hiring our first engineer, we flew the guy out and spent a weekend coding with him.

这些问题旨在帮助判断公司是否适合求职者。这与你们提到的要坦诚告知工作难易程度的观点相关。真正优秀的人渴望挑战困难，他们想要解决棘手问题。谷歌设计这些被认为非常困难的面试题目有其高明之处，因为喜欢解决真正难题的人会主动寻求这些机会。

我认为非常重要的一点是，即使公司规模扩大，也不应掩盖风险。我听说在PayPal，与彼得·蒂尔和马克斯·列夫琴等人面试后，他们会直言维萨和万事达想要消灭他们，而且他们可能在做违法的事情。但如果你成功了，你将重新定义支付行业。或者在招聘iPhone团队成员时，他们甚至不告诉应聘者具体工作内容。他们说三年内你将无法与家人团聚，但当你完成工作后，你的子孙后代会铭记你的成就。

我认为在招聘中这样做很好——既要清楚说明为什么这是绝佳机会，也要详细描述其中的困难。这样合适的人会选择加入，或者放弃这个机会。

不过有证据表明，能与子女相处对大多数人来说很重要。我认为在识别人才时，必须要有信心采用适合自己的面试方式。如果你不是顶尖工程师却要面试工程岗位候选人，很容易想要模仿别人的做法——让应聘者在白板上写代码，进行常规工程面试。在Stripe招聘第一位工程师时，我们让候选人飞过来，花了一个周末与他一起编程。

And I think you can actually extend that to other roles, where again you're not an expert. I'm no business development guru, but when we interview people for business development roles, we'll ask them to do a project. They talk about how they would improve an existing partnership that Stripe has, or which new partnerships they would go out and do. Even though it's not my domain area, I am actually confident enough that I can judge those pretty well. I think people often have this imposter syndrome when it comes to interviewing for roles.

我认为实际上可以将这种方法扩展到其他职位，即使你也不是该领域的专家。我不是业务发展专家，但当我们面试业务发展职位的人选时，我们会要求他们完成一个项目。他们会谈论如何改进Stripe现有的合作伙伴关系，或者会去建立哪些新的合作伙伴关系。尽管这不是我的专业领域，但我实际上有足够的信心能够很好地评估这些内容。我认为人们在面试职位时常常会有冒名顶替综合症。

I think a pretty specific, tactical thing to do for the first 10 people is to work with them as much as you can before committing to hiring them. Once you reach a certain scale it's kind of impractical because it's a huge time commitment on their side, and ultimately it would be expensive from your side. But it's really worth it to get the first ten people right. For a majority, maybe in all of the first ten people, we worked with them in some capacity, usually for a week in advance. It's pretty hard to fake it for a week, it tends to be pretty clear quite quickly.

我认为对于前10名员工，一个相当具体且实用的做法是在决定聘用他们之前，尽可能多地与他们合作。一旦达到一定规模，这种做法就不太实际了，因为对他们来说需要投入大量时间，最终对你来说成本也会很高。但为了确保前10名员工选对，这确实很值得。对于大多数，也许是所有前10名员工，我们都以某种形式与他们合作过，通常提前一周。要伪装一周是相当困难的，往往很快就能看得很清楚。

Another thing I thought of to the question of how do you know who is great or who is good enough. People always talk about this notion of the ten x person, whatever that skill set is. I don't really know what ten x means. I think maybe the slightly more helpful or intuitive version of that is: is this person probably the best out of all of their friends at what they do? It's a little bit sensitive to how well they chose friends, how many they have. But for me at least, I find that a more helpful way to think about it: is this the best engineer this engineer knows?

关于如何判断谁很优秀或谁足够好的问题，我想到的另一点是：人们总是谈论十倍人才的概念，无论那是什么技能组合。我其实不太清楚十倍是什么意思。我认为可能更有帮助或更直观的版本是：这个人在他们所从事的领域是否可能是他们所有朋友中最优秀的？这在某种程度上取决于他们选择朋友的质量和数量。但至少对我来说，我发现这是一种更有用的思考方式：这是这位工程师所认识的最好的工程师吗？

and you know looked over his shoulder and
kind of, it was the only way
we could really tell and
get ourselves confident
that, that person was good.

And the other thing I think that's actually probably just worth mentioning in all of those kind of first ten people, or even more generally on the culture and hiring topic. I think everyone sort of doesn't realize until they go through it themselves how important it is, in large part because in life and the media and everything, people focus way too much on founders. And they're like, here we are. And so kind of, we're re-enforcing the sort of structural narrative that like, Stripe is about John and Patrick, and Pinterest is about Ben and so forth. Whereas, I mean, obviously, sort of the vast majority of what our companies do like 99.9% is being done by people who are not us. Right? And I think, I mean, that's kind of, it's obvious when you say it, but it's at a very much, not just the macro narrative and you know, companies are abstract. So you kind of need to associate them with people. But I think it's worth bearing in mind that like for Apple, you know everything was you know, Steve Jobs was a like tiny, tiny detail at the end, right, or Google was that way, and so forth.

另外我认为在所有前十名员工招聘中，甚至更广泛地在文化和招聘话题上，都值得提及的一点是：人们往往要亲身经历后才能意识到这件事的重要性。这在很大程度上是因为在生活中、媒体上和各种场合里，人们过度关注创始人。他们总是说"我们来了"。因此我们某种程度上强化了这种结构性叙事，比如Stripe就是约翰和帕特里克的故事，Pinterest就是本的故事等等。然而，我的意思是，显然我们公司99.9%的工作都是由我们之外的人完成的。对吧？我认为，虽然说出来很明显，但这不仅仅体现在宏观叙事层面，而且公司本身是抽象的，所以你需要将其与人联系起来。但值得记住的是，对于苹果公司来说，史蒂夫·乔布斯最终只是其中极其微小的细节，谷歌也是如此。

So don't screw it up, is that what you're saying? Something like that. I think, you know, one other thing I'll mention is that I think referencing people is really important, and referencing people is just what it sounds like. You're basically asking people who have real, material working experience, for their honest opinion. And we do that really aggressively, and what we're trying to figure out is what's this person like to work with? We're not trying to validate like whether they told the truth on their resume, because we assume that they're telling the truth. So, very standard questions that I'll ask somebody who's in an interview, I might say, hey, we both know Jonathan in common. I'm gonna talk to him, you know, in a couple weeks, cause we're both social friends. Like if I asked him, what you're the best at, or what you would be most proud of, or what you were kind of working to improve. What would he or she say?

所以你的意思是不要搞砸了？差不多是这样。我想提到的另一点是，我认为背景调查非常重要，背景调查就是字面意思。你基本上是在向有实际工作经历的人征求他们的真实意见。我们在这方面做得非常积极，我们试图了解的是与这个人共事是什么感觉？我们不是要验证他们在简历上是否说了实话，因为我们假设他们说的是实话。所以，在面试中我会问一些非常标准的问题，我可能会说：嘿，我们都认识乔纳森。我几周后会和他聊聊，因为我们是社交朋友。如果我问他在你最擅长什么，或者你最自豪的是什么，或者你正在努力改进什么方面，他会怎么说？

Because it sort of tests the

It creates a level of self awareness and a bit of social accountability. Then I'll try to ask something that makes the question, which is typically very soft, feel more quantitative and calibrate that over time. So in evaluating this person or this dimension, do you think this is the top 1% of people you've ever worked with? The top 5% or the top 10%? It forces a scarcity that gives a materially different reference than if you just ask what's the best thing about John. They might say he's good at these things, and when you ask for validation, they'll just agree because they don't gain anything. So I think that's just a tool that people should take seriously. Referencing isn't easy to begin with, but it proves really useful over time. Especially for named references, people really want to be nice, so you have to create artificial scarcity by asking where they would rank this person among the people they've worked with in this role. Usually I aim to spend about 15 minutes on the phone with that person, not just let them say this person is awesome and then hang up. Those references are also a tremendous source of new recruits.

这能建立一定程度的自我认知和些许社会责任感。然后我会尝试提出一些让原本通常很主观的问题变得更具量化性的内容，并随着时间推移进行校准。在评估这个人或这个维度时，你认为这是你共事过的人中前1%的水平吗？前5%还是前10%？这种稀缺性设定提供了与简单询问"约翰最大的优点是什么"截然不同的参考标准。他们可能会说他擅长这些方面，当你要求核实时，他们只会表示同意，因为他们不会因此获得任何好处。所以我认为这是一个人们应该认真对待的工具。背景调查本身就不容易，但随着时间的推移确实证明非常有用。特别是对于指定推荐人，人们往往想要表现得友善，因此你必须通过询问他们会在同职位共事过的人中将此人排在什么位置来制造人为的稀缺性。通常我目标是与对方通话约15分钟，而不是仅仅让他们说这个人很棒就挂断电话。这些背景调查也是新招聘人员的极佳来源。

What have each of you learned about? Here's your computer, we already set up your environment, don't worry about it. This is the problem that we have to solve together. And then because of the nature of the startups, we were all in this tiny, two bedroom apartment. All of the other things, like building personal relationships, spending time together, getting to know one another, it just all happened kind of automatically. Like, you didn't have to do anything. The one thing that I would add to that is, though, we would always try to remind people of where we wanted to go some day. Because it's really easy when you first join to drop somebody into a problem, and then they think the whole world is like this little problem in front of them. We'd always say, hey, some day we wanna do for Discovery what Google did for search. This is our plan for trying to get that done. Now as the company grows, I think that process has to get a little bit more formalized. And so we spend a lot of time thinking, and honestly trying to constantly refine what that person's experience looks like from the day they came in, to their very first interview, through 30 days after they joined. Like do they have somebody whose name they know? Do they know who their manager is? Have they sat down with people on their team? Do they know what the general architecture of the company is, and what the top priorities are? And we have a program and it's a week long, and then there are some function specific programs that go in deeper. And that's something that's always been refined. And the alpha metrics that we look on that, it's when we ask people like what did you think afterwards and then 30 days afterwards. And then we also ask their peers and their manager, like hey, is this person kind of up to speed? Do you feel like we've done a good job making them productive? And if we haven't, that's a key A, that team shouldn't be hiring anymore people, because they're not doing a good job bringing in new people. And B, that we need to retool that.

你们各自学到了什么？这是你们的电脑，我们已经设置好了你们的环境，不用担心。这是我们需要共同解决的问题。由于初创公司的特性，我们都挤在这个小小的两居室公寓里。所有其他事情，比如建立人际关系、共度时光、相互了解，都是自然而然地发生的。就像你什么都不用做。不过我想补充一点，我们总是试图提醒人们我们将来想要达到的目标。因为当你刚加入时，很容易让人陷入某个具体问题，然后他们就以为整个世界就是眼前这个小问题。我们总是说，嘿，总有一天我们要为探索领域做出谷歌为搜索所做的贡献。这就是我们实现这一目标的计划。随着公司的发展，我认为这个过程需要更加规范化。所以我们花了很多时间思考，并诚实地努力不断优化员工从入职第一天开始的体验，从第一次面试到入职30天后。比如他们是否认识某个同事？他们知道自己的经理是谁吗？他们是否与团队成员坐下来交流过？他们是否了解公司的整体架构和首要任务？我们有一个为期一周的培训项目，还有一些针对具体职能的深入培训项目。这是需要不断优化的方面。我们关注的关键指标是，在培训后和30天后询问人们的反馈。我们还会询问他们的同事和经理，比如这个人是否已经跟上节奏？你觉得我们在让他们高效工作方面做得好吗？如果做得不好，关键点A是那个团队不应该再招聘新人，因为他们在引进新员工方面做得不好；B是我们需要重新调整培训方案。

And so I think those things are important. I just wouldn't discount just how important it is to get to know the person as a person. Like what are their aspirations? What's their working style? How do they like to be recognized? Do they really prefer being in total silence? Are they a morning person or night person? Like knowing those things I think, it just demonstrates that you care about them individually as well as collectively, like what you goals are.

因此我认为这些事情很重要。我不会低估了解一个人本身的重要性。比如他们的抱负是什么？他们的工作风格是怎样的？他们希望如何获得认可？他们是否真的更喜欢完全安静的环境？他们是早起的人还是夜猫子？我认为了解这些事情恰恰表明你既关心他们个人，也关心集体目标。

I think there are two things that are important at any stage through the implementation of a change. The first is to get them up and running, doing real work quickly. Because that's only when you can find the problems, that's how progress is measured, is how much real work they're doing. And so, you know, when we have engineers start, we'll try to get them committing on the first day. When we have people in business roles start, we will have them in real meetings on the first day, on what they're meant to be working on.

我认为在实施变革的任何阶段，有两件事都很重要。第一是让他们尽快上手并开始做实际工作。因为只有这样才能发现问题，这也是衡量进展的方式，就是看他们做了多少实际工作。所以，当工程师入职时，我们会尽量让他们在第一天就提交代码。当商务人员入职时，我们会在第一天就让他们参加实际会议，讨论他们应该负责的工作内容。

But I think sometimes there's a tendency to be tentative, and help ease people in. We're much more of the push people off the cliff school. And then I think the second, is to try and start quickly giving people feedback, and especially feedback on how to adapt to the culture. Because when you think about it, if you have built a strong culture as all the companies up here are trying to, then it's going to take some adapting for the person. It's not going to be necessarily easy.

但我认为有时会有试探性的倾向，帮助人们慢慢适应。我们更像是"把人推下悬崖"学派。然后我认为第二点是尽快开始给人们反馈，特别是关于如何适应文化的反馈。因为当你思考这个问题时，如果你像这里所有公司都在努力做的那样建立了强大的文化，那么新员工就需要一些适应过程。这不一定容易。

One thing we have at Stripe, is just the culture was a lot more written. And so, you have people who are right next to each other each with headphones on, and just like IM'ing away to each other. And for a lot of people coming in who hadn't worked in an environment like that, it's sort of hard. In normal places. Exactly. Yeah.

Stripe的一个特点是文化更倾向于书面交流。所以你会看到人们即使坐在一起也戴着耳机，通过即时消息互相交流。对于许多从未在这种环境中工作过的新员工来说，这有点困难。在普通的地方确实如此。没错。是的。

And so, everything from kind of high level how you're doing at your job, to kind

The more feedback you can give them, the better they'll do. And it's unnatural, right? Because it's unnatural to be constantly telling people that they're doing a good or bad job. You don't do that, hopefully, in your normal life, you're more restrained. But when you have employees, that's kind of what you owe them for them to do well.

你给他们的反馈越多，他们就会做得越好。但这其实很不自然，对吧？因为不断告诉别人他们做得好或不好是很不自然的。在正常生活中你不会这样做，希望你会更克制。但当你有了员工，这某种程度上是你欠他们的，为了让他们表现出色。

There are a lot of changes. I mean, I think one thing that we try to do on the team side is, the goal is to make the teams feel as autonomous and nimble as possible within the constraints of having a large organization. And that means over time, we're always trying to make it feel like a start-up of many start-ups, rather than this monolithic organization with a set of foreign processes that cut horizontally through it. And it's easier said than done. I think that, like we're not all the way there. But one of our goals is that each team has, they control the resources that they need to get things done, they know what the most important thing is, and how it's measured. And in that way, then the management problem becomes somewhat tractable, otherwise it feels completely impossible if you can't decompose it into autonomous units. Like you just look at it, and you're like, oh my gosh, communication complexity is increasing geometrically. Management complexity, like it's never gonna work, and so you have to sort of create these abstracted units, or that's at least what we're gonna try to do.

变化很多。我的意思是，在团队方面我们尝试做的一件事是，目标是在大型组织的限制下，让团队尽可能感受到自主和灵活。这意味着随着时间的推移，我们始终努力让它感觉像是由许多初创公司组成的初创公司，而不是一个拥有横向贯穿的陌生流程的单一庞大组织。这说起来容易做起来难。我认为我们还没有完全达到目标。但我们的目标之一是让每个团队都拥有完成工作所需的资源控制权，他们知道最重要的是什么，以及如何衡量。这样，管理问题就变得相对可控了，否则如果你不能将其分解为自主单元，就会感觉完全不可能。就像你看着它，你会想，天啊，沟通复杂性正在几何级增长。管理复杂性，就像它永远不会奏效，所以你必须创建这些抽象单元，或者至少这是我们要尝试做的。

These are minor cultural pointers, and that makes the problem really hard. But that's kind of core to our philosophy of how we build products. We try to put people together that have all of these different disciplines. They're curious about lots of things. And then we anchor them on a single project and then we try to remove barriers to let them go fast. When we find new barriers, we sit down and we think, how do we speed that up?

I think hiring is a little bit different. And I think the biggest change and the biggest asset that you get as you get more people is referrals become more and more the life blood depending on the network of all the people that you bring in. So one of the really lucky, and in hindsight, great decisions that we made, was actually the 14th or 15th person that we hired was a professional recruiter and she had worked at start-ups. She had worked at big companies like Apple. But she knew where that pipeline breaks down, knew the early indicators, and taught everyone not just how to screen for talent, but how scalably to identify the people that are gonna be culturally, really good for the company. And I think looking back on that, it's something that I personally really value.

You know, there's just a huge amount of stuff here, right? In that I guess, this is all under kinda the rubric of managing growth. And either your company fails very quickly or all of your problems become in some way about managing growth. One thing that I think tends to take people by surprise, and certainly took me by surprise, is kind of how quickly just like the time horizon has changed. In that, in your first month you're largely thinking about things maybe one month ahead, right? In that, maybe that's kind of what your development road map is oriented around, even in terms of who you're working with. Maybe it's like, informal relationships where they haven't fully committed to remain full time or whatever, right? And then, the more time goes by, I think that kind of has a reciprocal, or corresponding increase in

这些都是次要的文化指标，这使得问题变得非常棘手。但这正是我们产品构建理念的核心所在。我们努力将拥有各种不同专业背景的人聚集在一起。他们对很多事情都充满好奇心。然后我们将他们固定在一个项目上，并努力消除障碍，让他们快速推进。当我们发现新的障碍时，我们会坐下来思考：如何加快速度？

我认为招聘有些不同。我认为随着人员增加，最大的变化和最大的资产就是推荐变得越来越重要，成为生命线，这取决于你引进的所有人脉网络。所以我们做出的一个非常幸运、事后看来也很棒的决定，是我们实际雇佣的第14或第15个人是一名专业招聘人员，她曾在初创公司工作过。她也在像苹果这样的大公司工作过。但她知道招聘流程在哪里会出问题，了解早期指标，并教会了每个人不仅如何筛选人才，还如何可扩展地识别那些在文化上真正适合公司的人。回想起来，我认为这是我个人非常重视的一点。

你知道，这里涉及的内容非常多，对吧？我想这些都属于管理增长的范畴。要么你的公司很快失败，要么你所有的问题在某种程度上都变成了管理增长的问题。我认为有一件事往往让人措手不及，当然也让我措手不及，就是时间跨度变化得如此之快。也就是说，在第一个月，你主要考虑的可能是一个月后的事情，对吧？也许你的开发路线图就是围绕这个时间跨度来制定的，甚至包括你与谁合作。可能就像非正式的关系，他们还没有完全承诺全职工作之类的，对吧？然后，随着时间的推移，我认为这种时间跨度会有相应的，或者说对应的增长

After one year, you're thinking one year ahead. After four years, you're thinking four years ahead. But that increases very quickly, right? After one month, it's again super short term. And then just 11 months later you should now actually be thinking and planning a year ahead, and thinking about human structures on that time horizon. Thinking about the stuff Ben talked about, like where you want to be going long term and things like that. I think that also plays into your hiring and the kinds of people you hire, right? In the really early days you have to hire people who will be productive essentially immediately. You don't have the luxury of hiring people who are really promising, but they're not quite gonna be up to speed for another year or two. They have to be able to contribute immediately. But after two or three years, now it starts to get much more reasonable to make those investments, and in fact, if you're not making those investments, you're probably being much too short term. And so I think that's really important. A lot of it also just comes from all these problems in some sense are easy, like how do you build good social bonds between people? I mean, we all do it every day, right? It's kind of, how do you make it systematic and effective at scale? It's always a very severely imperfect approximation of what you would ideally do if you were small, and what hacks can you pull to make it work as well as you possibly can at a larger scale. Like a rapidly growing company, say growing headcount two or three times a year, it is a very unnatural thing. And so it's, what's the least bad way of managing that period of growth? Human organizations aren't designed for it and I think it's worth being quite systematic about thinking about ways to do that. But realizing that you probably can't do much better than adequation.

一年后，你会考虑未来一年的规划。四年后，你会考虑未来四年的规划。但这种时间跨度增长得非常快，对吧？一个月后，又回到了超级短期的状态。而仅仅11个月后，你现在实际上应该开始思考和规划未来一年的事情，并在那个时间跨度上考虑人员架构。思考本谈到的事情，比如你希望长期发展的方向等等。我认为这也会影响你的招聘策略和所聘用人员的类型，对吧？在早期阶段，你基本上必须聘用那些能立即产生效益的人。你没有条件去聘用那些很有潜力但需要一两年才能完全上手的人。他们必须能够立即做出贡献。但两三年后，现在开始进行这类投资就变得合理得多，事实上，如果你不进行这些投资，你的眼光可能就太过短浅了。所以我认为这非常重要。从某种意义上说，很多问题其实都很简单，比如如何在人与人之间建立良好的社交纽带？我们每天都在做这件事，对吧？关键在于如何使其系统化并在规模上保持有效性？这始终是对理想状态下（如果规模较小）所能做到的事情的一个严重不完美的近似，你需要采取哪些变通方法，使其在更大规模下尽可能良好运作。就像一个快速发展的公司，比如每年人员规模增长两到三倍，这是非常不自然的事情。所以问题在于，用什么最不坏的方式来管理这个增长期？人类组织并非为此而设计，我认为非常有必要系统性地思考实现这一目标的方法。但要意识到你可能无法做得比"足够好"更好多少。

Corresponding increase in the time horizons. Long tables where everyone can sit together, right? And if you think of net, how much more total human interaction happens as a result of having these kind of randomly mixed meals, it's vast, right? And it's kind of a whole list of things like that. But, I think that's kind of the general framework.

相应的时间范围也在增加。大家都能坐在一起的长桌，对吧？如果你从整体上考虑，由于这种随机混合用餐方式而产生的总人际互动量要大得多，对吧？这就像是一整套类似的事情。但我认为这大致就是总体框架。

One thing I'm really curious about you guys value transparency. How have you scaled it over time? I know we think about figuring it out all the time, just curious.

有件事我很好奇，你们重视透明度。随着时间推移，你们是如何扩展这一理念的？我知道我们一直在思考如何解决这个问题，只是好奇。

So you know, start-ups, I can't remember who it was, defined it as a start-up is an organization that's not yet stuck with all of these principle agent problems. That at most large companies, what is locally optimal for you is very frequently not what is globally optimal for the company. And so there are, as a consequence of that, probably a lot of ways in which a start-up can work differently to a big company.

你知道，初创公司，我不记得是谁说的，将其定义为一个尚未陷入所有这些委托代理问题的组织。在大多数大公司里，对你局部最优的选择往往不是对公司全局最优的选择。因此，由于这个原因，初创公司可能有很多方面与大公司的运作方式不同。

At a big company, a lot of the things that are good for you, well, you couldn't do them in a completely transparent environment, right? Because people would think less of you or you're doing things you're not supposed to. But because everyone is kind of sailing in the, or rowing in the same direction at a start-up, you can actually just make all of the information transparent.

在大公司里，很多对你有好处的事情，在完全透明的环境中你是无法做到的，对吧？因为人们会看轻你，或者认为你在做不该做的事情。但在初创公司，因为大家都在朝着同一个方向航行或划船，你实际上可以让所有信息都变得透明。

And so, I guess I mentioned earlier, Stripe used to BCC every other person at Stripe on basically every single outgoing email unless you opted out of it, because we thought that would be much more efficient. You wouldn't need to have as many meetings, if you just kind of keep abreast of what's happening.

所以，我想我之前提到过，Stripe过去基本上每封外发邮件都会密送给公司里的其他人，除非你选择退出，因为我们认为这样效率会高得多。如果你能及时了解正在发生的事情，就不需要开那么多会议。

And over time we've sort of built an increasingly intricate framework of mailing lists and we now have a program for generating Gmail filters. And for like a pretty rocky patch where 50 people or so, to Ben's point of like, asking people how they're getting on after the first couple of days. They're reported terribly because like they couldn't even find all the emails that people were sending to them and they were missing things and everything.

随着时间的推移，我们建立了一个越来越复杂的邮件列表框架，现在我们有一个生成Gmail过滤器的程序。在一个相当艰难的时期，大约有50人左右，就像Ben说的那样，在头几天后询问大家情况如何。他们报告的情况很糟糕，因为他们甚至找不到人们发送给他们的所有邮件，他们遗漏了很多东西。

Gmail broke at one stage. Oh, right, at one point Gmail broke because we were just like sending too much email. It is hard to scale, because

Gmail在某个阶段崩溃了。哦，对了，有一次Gmail崩溃了，因为我们发送的邮件太多了。这很难扩展，因为

It is hard to scale, because

You might contact somebody outside of the company with some great idea, and maybe the person sitting across the way from you thinks that's like the stupidest idea they've ever heard, right? And you're kind of subject to the scrutiny of the entire organization, to some degree, with all of your communication. Like kind of the challenging side of it. Then the good side is people are much more informed about what's happening. I guess I don't feel that I can give much stronger endorsement of it than it has worked so far.

你可能会联系公司外部的某个人，提出一些很棒的想法，而坐在你对面的同事可能认为这是他们听过的最愚蠢的主意，对吧？在某种程度上，你的所有沟通都要接受整个组织的审视。这算是具有挑战性的一面。而好的一面是人们能更了解正在发生的事情。我想除了"到目前为止它都运作良好"之外，我无法给出更有力的认可了。

That's a pretty good endorsement. Yeah, I'm actually really curious how or whether it'll work when we're 5,000 people or something like that. If we're ever at that scale. I think the two things that have helped us scale it are one, changing the tools and two, developing the culture around it.

这是个相当不错的认可。是的，我其实很好奇当我们发展到5000人左右时，这种方式是否还能奏效。如果我们真的达到那个规模的话。我认为帮助我们扩展规模的两个因素是：第一，改变工具；第二，围绕它发展文化。

On the tools front, it used to be the case that you could keep abreast by what's happening in the company by reading all the email. Now we have weekly all-hands sometimes on the deck, and we actually have to put all this work into developing a deck to communicate to people what's going on in the company, since there's so much more.

在工具方面，过去的情况是你可以通过阅读所有邮件来了解公司动态。现在我们每周都有全员会议，有时使用演示文稿，实际上我们必须投入大量工作来制作演示文稿，向员工传达公司的情况，因为现在信息量要大得多。

On the cultural side, with so much information being available internally, you have to develop cultural norms around how it's treated. Obvious things like the fact that a lot of it's confidential to Stripe. But even less obvious things like when emailing someone or talking in Slack or IRESE, when that is viewed by now 170 people, it's pretty easy to get stage fright.

在文化方面，由于内部有如此多的信息可用，你必须建立关于如何处理这些信息的文化规范。明显的事情比如很多信息对Stripe来说是保密的。但不太明显的事情比如在给某人发邮件或在Slack或IRESE上交谈时，当这些内容被现在的170人看到时，很容易让人感到怯场。

It's pretty easy for what you thought was a reasonable proposal, you get this drive-by criticism. And you're now less likely to share in the future. So we've had to create norms around when it's reasonable to jump into discussions and how that interaction works. Because people are on the stage so much more.

你自认为合理的提议很容易遭到随意的批评。这样你将来就不太愿意分享了。因此，我们必须建立规范，明确何时适合参与讨论以及这种互动如何运作。因为人们现在处于"舞台"上的时间要多得多。

I'm pretty sure it's not good, but, not to put her on the spot but Emily interned at Stripe this summer. I'm curious, like, as an intern, what you

我很确定这不太好，但并非要让艾米丽难堪，她今年夏天在Stripe实习过。我很好奇，作为一名实习生，你

I'm curious, like, as an intern, what you

What do you think of it? I think, overall, it's great. I think, like, my first week, I spent most of the time reading Hackpad and getting caught up on what the company was doing. It can often be quite distracting from your own work, as there are oftentimes other parts of the company you're really interested in. Hackpad, by the way, is like Google Docs, but with a news feed and that way you can just like see all the documents. Yeah, and you're encouraged to make everything public, everything you work on. But overall, it gets you spun up really quickly. And we also have things called spin ups where every single leader of a team at the company, whether it's sys or it's product gives like a 30 minute talk on what their team is currently doing and how you can contribute, if you're interested.

你觉得怎么样？我认为总体而言很棒。比如我第一周大部分时间都在阅读Hackpad，了解公司正在进行的业务。这常常会分散你对自己工作的注意力，因为公司里总有些其他部门让你很感兴趣。顺便说一下，Hackpad类似于谷歌文档，但带有新闻推送功能，这样你就能查看所有文件。是的，公司鼓励将所有工作内容公开。但总的来说，它能让你快速上手。我们还有所谓的"快速入门"活动，公司每个团队的负责人，无论是系统团队还是产品团队，都会进行30分钟的演讲，介绍他们团队当前的工作内容以及如果你感兴趣如何参与其中。

Do you think email transparency was net good? Yes I remember having a hard time understanding what I should and should not subscribe to. And the first week having 2,000 emails in my inbox and then by the end there are three or four teams you actually want that information coming in from.

你认为邮件透明度总体来说是好事吗？是的，我记得当时很难理解应该订阅哪些邮件，不应该订阅哪些。第一周我的收件箱里有2000封邮件，但到最后你真正希望接收信息的团队只有三四个。

So this question is for Patrick and John. Is it your experience that your early hires begin to grow and evolve into leadership roles as the company scales? And a question for Ben, what is the difference today? What is the difference in your initial product launch and the audience would be?

这个问题是给Patrick和John的。根据你们的经验，早期招聘的员工是否随着公司规模的扩大而成长并演变为领导角色？还有一个问题给Ben，今天的区别是什么？你们最初产品发布时的受众与现在有什么不同？

The people, actually all three of you are welcome to answer this, have the people that you hired early been able to grow into leadership roles? In the Stripe case, yes, in that quite a number of the first ten people are in leadership roles now. I think that's one thing that organizations, again it's an unnatural skill that they have to get good at, is realizing that people don't necessarily come out of the womb being good at managing or being good at leadership and being able to develop that in people, and being able to help people progress as they spend a number of years

实际上欢迎你们三位都回答这个问题：你们早期招聘的员工是否能够成长为领导角色？就Stripe而言，是的，前十名员工中有相当多的人现在担任领导职务。我认为这是组织需要擅长的一项非天生技能，就是要认识到人们并非生来就擅长管理或领导，而是需要在人员中培养这种能力，并能够在他们工作多年期间帮助其进步

They spend a number of years at the company. It's a lot of work at a time when everyone is running around with their hair on fire, but it's also damaging if the company can't develop that skill. Yeah, I think for us the answer is some yes and some no. I think one of the big benefits of working at a start-up is that you can be handed a challenge that no one else would be crazy enough to give you the opportunity to take on. And that could be managing people. It could be taking on a project. But the implicit contract with that is that if you're going to ask somebody to take a really big risk on that, it shouldn't be like one-way through the door and if you don't succeed, otherwise it creates fright to give it a shot. So we have some folks that are managing large teams that started as individual programmers, where they were engineering and they said hey, I would love to try. I'd love to try leading a project and then leading a group and then taking responsibility for management, taking a group. And we've had other folks that tried it and they were like, I'm really glad I tried it because I never wanna do that again. We try to make sure that, for those people, like you can have just as much impact at a company through your individual contributions as an engineer or designer. You don't have to manage. But it's really hard to predict until you give people a shot. And so my strong preference is that you give as many people a shot as possible, in the few areas where you really feel like there's too much learning curve relative to the business objective you're trying to achieve. That's when you look for somebody who might be able to walk in and really execute well in that job.

他们在公司工作了很多年。当每个人都忙得焦头烂额时，这是一项繁重的工作，但如果公司不能培养这种技能，也会造成损害。是的，我认为对我们来说，答案是既有肯定也有否定。我认为在初创公司工作的一个主要好处是，你可以接手一个其他人都不够疯狂去给你机会承担的挑战。这可能是管理人员，也可能是承担一个项目。但其中的隐含契约是，如果你要让某人承担如此大的风险，就不应该像单行道一样，如果你不成功，就会让人害怕尝试。所以我们有一些从独立程序员开始的人现在管理着大型团队，他们原本从事工程工作，然后说，嘿，我想试试。我想尝试领导一个项目，然后领导一个团队，然后承担管理责任，带领一个团队。我们也有其他人尝试过，他们说，我很高兴我尝试了，因为我再也不想做那种事了。我们努力确保，对于这些人来说，作为工程师或设计师，你可以通过个人贡献在公司产生同样大的影响。你不必从事管理。但在给人们机会之前，真的很难预测。因此，我强烈倾向于尽可能多地给人们机会，只有在那些你觉得相对于你试图实现的业务目标而言学习曲线太陡峭的少数领域，你才需要寻找那些能够直接上手并在该职位上表现出色的人。

Are you going to answer the other question? Early on, we discovered that looking at other people's collections turns out to be this really amazing way to discover things that you didn't know you were looking for. It becomes kind of a solution to a problem that a lot of other technologies don't have. And so, over the last couple years especially, we've poured enormous technical and design resources into building out recommendations products, search products, and feed products. We're leveraging the unique data that we have, which are these pins that were all hand-picked by someone and hand-categorized.

On the audience side, the first big surprise was truthfully when we first started, we didn't really know if anyone would use it. We were just happy that anybody that wasn't related to us and obligated by familial relationship would use it. One of the biggest surprises has been how many people and how diverse those groups of people have been. I think that's been one of the things that's really exciting.

The funny thing is, that as the company goes farther along, your aspirations therefore get bigger. So there's this gap that always exists between where we are and where I think we should be. Even though objectively we're much farther along, I feel like the gap has widened even farther. But I think that's a really common trait among people who found companies.

你要回答另一个问题吗？早期我们发现，查看别人的收藏结果是一种非常奇妙的发现方式，能够找到你原本不知道自己在寻找的东西。这成为了许多其他技术所不具备的问题解决方案。因此，特别是在过去几年里，我们投入了大量的技术和设计资源来构建推荐产品、搜索产品和信息流产品。我们利用我们拥有的独特数据，这些图钉都是由某人精心挑选并手工分类的。

在受众方面，第一个大惊喜确实是在我们刚开始时，我们真的不知道是否有人会使用它。我们只是很高兴任何与我们没有亲属关系、没有家庭义务的人会使用它。最大的惊喜之一就是使用人数之多以及这些人群的多样性。我认为这是真正令人兴奋的事情之一。

有趣的是，随着公司发展得越远，你的抱负也因此变得更大。所以总是存在着这样一个差距，我告诉我的团队，在我们现在的位置和我认为我们应该达到的位置之间。尽管客观上我们已经走得更远，但我感觉这个差距反而变得更大了。但我认为这是创业者的一个非常普遍的特征。

So the question is, most start-ups are not the iPhone. You can't guarantee that people's grandchildren are gonna remember this because most start-ups fail. How do you convince people to sort of make sacrifices to join a start-up? I think, part of the way in which it resonates with people is because it's not guaranteed, right? If it were guaranteed then it'd be boring. And so it's that there is the prospect of affecting this outcome, but nothing more than that potential.

问题是，大多数初创公司都不是iPhone。你无法保证人们的孙辈会记住这些，因为大多数初创公司都会失败。你如何说服人们做出牺牲加入初创公司？我认为，它之所以能引起人们共鸣的部分原因在于它没有保证，对吧？如果是有保证的，那就会很无聊。所以关键在于存在影响结果的可能性，但仅此而已。

To the not seeing their families or kids, start-ups often do involve longer hours in the beginning, but I think that particular story is probably somewhat overstated. I think it was kind of this tendency to exaggerate it. I mean it's like the startup version of fishing. Every startup thinks they worked even more insane hours than the next one back in the early days. So I don't know. I think that realistically for most people, it's not that big a sacrifice, right? You're, maybe on average, being really realistic about it, you'll work two hours more on average per day. It's certainly a sacrifice, but it is not forgoing all pleasure and enjoyment for the next half decade.

关于无法陪伴家人或孩子的问题，初创公司在初期确实经常需要更长的工作时间，但我认为这种说法可能有些夸大。我认为这是一种夸大其词的倾向。这就像是初创公司版的钓鱼故事。每个初创公司都认为自己在早期比其他公司工作得更疯狂。所以我不知道。我认为对大多数人来说，现实情况是这并非那么大的牺牲，对吧？如果你真的很现实地看待这个问题，可能平均每天只需要多工作两个小时。这当然是一种牺牲，但并不是要你在未来五年内放弃所有的快乐和享受。

Yeah, I mean, I think even the iPhone wasn't the iPhone before it got done, right? I mean, no smart person you're hiring is under the illusion that you have a crystal ball into the future that only you have, and that joining is a guaranteed thing. And in fact, if you're telling him that and they select in, you probably shouldn't hire them. Because they didn't pass like a basic intelligence test about uncertainty in the future.

是的，我的意思是，即使是iPhone在完成之前也不是iPhone，对吧？我的意思是，你雇佣的聪明人都不会幻想你拥有预知未来的水晶球，而且加入就是有保障的事情。事实上，如果你这样告诉他们，而他们还是选择加入，那你可能不应该雇佣他们。因为他们没有通过关于未来不确定性的基本智力测试。

Their grandchildren can be proud of. But I think it's fair to say what's exciting and where you think you can go, and where it's going to be hard and chart your best plan. And then tell them why their role in it can be instrumental, because it is. I really liked what you said. If you tell people like hey we're gonna go to Mars, it attracts the best people and then you're incrementally closer to getting to Mars. And they know that going in. What I would discourage doing is just whitewashing all of that. And if people are joining because they want all this certainty and guarantee of working at Google, plus the perk of working in a small start up and more email, and transparency, that's a really negative sign. For example, when I interview people they'll often say oh, I'm really passionate at what you're doing, and then I'm like well, what else are you interviewing? And then they'll just list seven companies that have nothing to do with each other except they're at the same stage we're at. They're like, I love the problem of discovery, so I'm interviewing at Stripe, Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber. Now I'm also putting into my résumé into Google X, into that part of the division. And that's a sign that they're probably not being authentic with which they care about. And those folks often, when things get really hard, they won't stick it out and work through it. Because they were really signing up for an experience, not for achieving a goal. I think the other thing that motivates people a great deal, in addition to the prospect of them affecting some outcome is the personal development angle. And that a start up, just because it's much more lightly staffed, it's much less forgiving. Even if you're the best person in the world, whether or not you're the best or the worst person in the world, you're probably not going to significantly alter Google's trajectory.

他们的孙辈会为此感到自豪。但我认为可以这样说：明确什么是令人兴奋的、你认为可以前进的方向，以及哪些地方会很困难，并制定最佳计划。然后告诉他们为什么他们在其中的角色至关重要，因为事实如此。我真的很喜欢你所说的。如果你告诉人们我们要去火星，这会吸引最优秀的人才，然后你就离到达火星更近了一步。他们从一开始就明白这一点。我不鼓励做的就是粉饰这一切。如果有人加入是因为他们想要谷歌工作那样的确定性和保障，再加上小初创公司的福利、更多邮件和透明度，那是一个非常糟糕的迹象。例如，当我面试别人时，他们经常说，我对你们正在做的事情充满热情，然后我问，你还在面试哪些公司？然后他们会列出七家彼此毫无关联的公司，除了它们处于与我们相同的发展阶段。他们会说，我喜欢探索问题，所以我在面试Stripe、Dropbox、Airbnb、Uber。现在我也在向Google X和该部门投递简历。这表明他们可能对自己真正关心的事情并不真诚。这些人通常在事情变得非常困难时不会坚持下去并克服困难。因为他们真正追求的是一种经历，而不是实现一个目标。我认为另一个能极大激励人们的因素，除了影响某些结果的前景之外，就是个人发展的角度。而初创公司正因为人员配置更为精简，所以宽容度要低得多。即使你是世界上最优秀的人，无论你是最好还是最差的人，你都不太可能显著改变谷歌的发展轨迹。

[如果你真的想要衡量自己，看看自己能做出多大的贡献和影响，我认为这个前景对许多最优秀的人才来说都相当有吸引力。那么初创公司是一个更好的测试场所。]

[因此对我们来说，我们不得不稍微拓宽视野，广泛寻找那些对使命有雄心壮志的人。那些关心产品和我们的产品构建方法的人，即使从一开始他们就不是我们最早的用户。]

[我要补充的一点是，当我们谈到招聘早期员工确实很困难这个事实时。你知道，有些人还有其他很好的选择。你正处于非常糟糕的]
