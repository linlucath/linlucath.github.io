Very exciting, and thank you, Sam for having me. Sam and I have known each other for a long time because we were fellow Sequoia companies and we met in the early days of when he was on his company journey and so it's cool. So what he asked me to talk about today was a little bit about the hardware journey of building products. So what I want to do is give you guys a little bit of an overview of Jawbone: what we do, how we think about the world, and that informs how we build products and goes specifically into the process of how we design, how we develop, and how that all kind of comes together. And sort of what we do to change categories. So first off, I always like to start with the broadest thinking and the way we look at the world. As we think of ourselves at this intersection of really crafted innovation in engineering that's almost invisible to the user in terms of its functionality, and that's at the intersection of even beyond design. We've been doing design products for well over a decade now. We think of it as going, the conversation has shifted even beyond design into beauty. And it's that intersection of engineering meets beauty, and the whole point is to help people with a better life with technology. And largely speaking, we do play in this world of what everyone's talking about now is Internet of Things. We were there much longer before there was such a moniker. And the way we think about that is it's smart devices that have computing power and connectivity with sensors in them that are measuring all kinds of things. They're wirelessly connected and they're all talking to you.

非常激动，感谢萨姆邀请我。萨姆和我认识很久了，因为我们都是红杉资本投资的公司，在他创业早期我们就认识了，所以这很酷。他今天请我谈谈关于构建产品的硬件历程。我想给大家简要介绍一下 Jawbone：我们的业务内容、我们看待世界的方式，这决定了我们如何构建产品，并具体涉及我们如何设计、如何开发，以及所有这些如何协同工作。还有我们如何改变产品类别。首先，我总是喜欢从最宏观的思考和我们看待世界的方式开始。我们认为自己处于精心打造的工程创新交汇点，这种创新在功能上对用户几乎是隐形的，这甚至超越了设计的范畴。我们从事设计产品已经超过十年了。我们认为对话已经从设计转向了美。这就是工程与美的交汇点，其核心是通过技术帮助人们获得更好的生活。总的来说，我们确实涉足于现在大家都在谈论的物联网领域。在这个术语出现之前，我们早已涉足其中。我们对此的理解是：智能设备具有计算能力和连接性，内置传感器可以测量各种数据。它们无线连接，并且都在与你交流。

We started on this journey really early, actually out of engineering school here. We were developing core technology and decided to build consumer products around that. Our first consumer product was the headset. We created a headset that became a wearable computer - it was the first Jawbone headset. That was when we started thinking about wearable computing. We then invented the wireless speaker space around Bluetooth audio. Most recently, we focused our attention on the wearable health revolution, using many of the sensors from our first generation of headsets and applying them to other parts of the body to understand more about users.

我们很早就开始了这段旅程，实际上是从这里的工程学院开始的。我们当时正在开发核心技术，并决定围绕该技术构建消费产品。我们的第一款消费产品是耳机。我们创造了一款成为可穿戴计算机的耳机——这是第一款 Jawbone 耳机。那时我们开始思考可穿戴计算。随后我们围绕蓝牙音频发明了无线扬声器领域。最近，我们将注意力集中在可穿戴健康革命上，使用我们第一代耳机中的许多传感器，并将它们应用于身体的其他部位，以更好地了解用户。

You do desperately need these organizing principles so that it's easier for users to understand how to come in and interact with these services. So we think the thinking needs to shift from being less about the actual things to being about the individual user. And so ultimately, when everyone's talking about wearables and you have things like Google Glass and you have the stuff that we do and Apple Watch and all this stuff, ultimately what we believe is that when you have things on your body 24/7, they become this kind of perfect context engine for everything in the world around you, right? So my phone is not on me, it's in my jacket or sometimes on the charger. But my Up is on me, and it understands everything that's happening with me. It's tracking my heart rate. It's tracking my respiration. It's tracking all these different things. And when I say context engine, I know I can tell the smart thermostat in my nest that I'm hot or cold. That device doesn't have that understanding. I can tell it's hot, that device I'm hot because I'm sick, went for a run, it's hot outside. I can tell your car that you're falling asleep, that you're agitated or irritated. So this is ultimately where we think the world is moving, is that wearables are going to be the center of this revolution around everything being connected and smart and they're going to drive what a lot of those interactions are going to be and how they're going to work. Right? And so, that's sort of the first principle that we think about when we start to think about where are things going, and what we should build, and how do we think about new categories, right?

你们迫切需要这些组织原则，以便用户更容易理解如何接触并与这些服务互动。因此我们认为，思考的重点需要从关注实际物品转向关注个体用户。最终，当大家都在讨论可穿戴设备，比如谷歌眼镜、我们开发的产品、苹果手表等等，我们坚信当这些设备 24/7 佩戴在身上时，它们就会成为感知周围万物的完美情境引擎，对吧？我的手机并不随身携带，它可能在外套里或正在充电。但我的 Up 手环随身佩戴，它能理解我身上发生的一切——追踪心率、呼吸频率以及各种生理指标。当我提到情境引擎时，我知道能直接告诉 Nest 智能温控器我感觉冷或热，而设备本身不具备这种感知能力。我能告知设备"我很热"——可能是因为生病、刚跑步完或天气炎热。我能提醒你的汽车你正在打瞌睡，或者你正处于焦躁状态。这正是我们认为世界发展的最终方向：可穿戴设备将成为万物互联智能化革命的核心，它们将主导未来交互的形态与运作模式。对吧？因此，这算是我们思考未来发展轨迹、应该开发什么产品、如何规划新品类时的首要原则。

So in order for the vision of what we're talking about to happen, you actually need to be great at almost everything. We need to be great at what we call the full stack. We have to be amazing at building hardware, and these are hardware experiences that people have to keep on all the time. You have to wear them 24/7, because if you don't, then everything that I'm talking about is sort of a castle in the air. You can't actually create a service that people will engage with, or get lots of data off it to then go power all these other things, if it doesn't start with great hardware. So that's where we start. We try to build these magical experiences in hardware that absolutely powered by software. We have developed world class software application expertise. We've gotta be as good there from an engagement perspective as something like an Instagram or Whatsapp. And then on the data side we've gotta know what to do with this massive amount of information, and process it and push it, and have it work for the user. So we really see ourselves as being at the intersection, for the first time, of a company that's doing hardware, software, and data, as three kind of equal stools that have to work together in order to unlock that experience around something that's on you, knowing what's happening, and then talking to the rest of the world around you. So that's a pretty key piece of what we do. I think it's different than what a lot of other companies do. And it allows us and requires us to play at all levels of stack. Now this was a complicated thing for us to put together. Because typically, people who are great at hardware understand mechanical engineering, electrical engineering.

为了实现我们所说的愿景，你实际上需要在几乎所有方面都做到出色。我们需要在我们称之为全栈的领域表现出色。我们必须在硬件制造方面表现出色，这些是用户需要持续使用的硬件体验。你必须全天候佩戴它们，因为如果不这样做，那么我所说的一切都像是空中楼阁。如果从一开始就没有出色的硬件，你实际上无法创建一个用户愿意使用的服务，也无法从中获取大量数据来支持所有其他功能。所以这就是我们的起点。我们试图打造这些由软件驱动的神奇硬件体验。我们已经开发出世界级的软件应用专业知识。从用户参与度的角度来看，我们必须做到像 Instagram 或 Whatsapp 那样出色。然后在数据方面，我们必须知道如何处理这些海量信息，进行处理和推送，并使其为用户服务。因此，我们确实将自己视为首次处于硬件、软件和数据交汇点的公司，这三个平等的支柱必须协同工作，才能解锁围绕在你身上、了解正在发生什么、然后与你周围世界交流的体验。所以这是我们工作的关键部分。我认为这与许多其他公司的做法不同。这使我们能够并且要求我们在所有层级上发挥作用。这对我们来说是一个复杂的整合过程。因为通常来说，擅长硬件的人理解机械工程、电气工程。

They're not typically great at building software and services, right. It's a very different discipline and a very different skill set. So when we first put those pieces together, that created a lot of interesting friction in the company. Our software and application team was so used to moving really, really fast and iterating. Whereas in the hardware world, you gotta take your time because your iteration cycles are much more deliberate. You have tooling that takes 16 weeks. You can't just tweak stuff, and you can't hack it in the same way. And so what was interesting to see is we put all these pieces together, the hardware team learning to move faster, the software guys thinking more about how they resolve experiences before you actually have to ship it versus just throwing something out and AB testing it, and then the data science sort of informs all of that with more information to make different kinds of decisions. So how do we think about how we go, how do we build products, how do we change categories? First of all, everything for us is a system. Right, we don't think about it discreetly just as a piece of hardware, discreetly as an application or discretely as a platform. We think about it across the whole thing, and so this is an example with Up, right, where we have these tracking sensors on the body, algorithms there.

他们通常不太擅长构建软件和服务，对吧。这是一个非常不同的学科和非常不同的技能组合。所以当我们最初将这些部分整合在一起时，这在公司内部产生了许多有趣的摩擦。我们的软件和应用团队已经习惯了非常快速地推进和迭代。而在硬件领域，你必须慢慢来，因为迭代周期需要更加慎重。有些工具需要 16 周才能完成。你不能随意调整东西，也不能用同样的方式临时修改。有趣的是，当我们把所有部分整合在一起后，硬件团队学会了更快地行动，软件团队更多地思考如何在产品实际交付前解决体验问题，而不是简单地推出产品进行 A/B 测试，然后数据科学通过更多信息来为所有这些决策提供支持。那么我们如何思考前进方向，如何构建产品，如何改变品类？首先，对我们来说一切都是一个系统。是的，我们不会孤立地将其视为硬件、应用或平台。我们会从整体角度来思考，这就是 Up 的例子，我们在身体上安装了追踪传感器，配有算法。

How those things interact, information, driving insight on it, and then we have a huge platform of thousands of developers where they have thousands of apps that then plug in and also create more experiences. And so we think about it across the whole spectrum and I'll come back to this system think in a second. So what is the actual process of creation look like? And this is fun for me because we don't actually talk about this very often. It's quite, you know, we keep it confidential and private, and I know that we are talking now that we're on sort of a live cast everywhere. So it's fun for me to talk about this for the first time, because it's quite a deliberate process, right? And this is a little bit of what it looks like. And this is kind of a map where we are very unbridled in our imagination in the exploration phase. We start to validate some of our concepts, bring those ideas tighter and tighter and tighter, and then we actually start to build a product, launch it, and then iterate, right? That's the simplest way to look at it. I'll take you through each of these steps. So in the exploration phase, it is very wild. It's imaginative. We think about the vision of where the world's going, what our strategy is, what the brand stands for. And we think of it a lot of what you guys do here. You're dreaming, you're imagining it, how do you disrupt, what's the future going to look like? Right? It is a little bit science projecty sometimes, and we talk about it in that way, right, and we do build from inspiration and insight. And that's sort of raw creativity. And we want to create, and we try to create.

这些事物如何相互作用，信息如何驱动洞察，然后我们拥有一个由数千名开发者组成的庞大平台，他们有数千个应用程序可以接入并创造更多体验。因此我们从整个频谱来思考这个问题，我稍后会回到这个系统思维。那么实际的创作过程是怎样的呢？这对我来说很有趣，因为我们实际上很少谈论这个。你知道，我们一直将其保密，我知道我们现在是在全球直播中谈论。所以对我来说第一次谈论这个很有趣，因为这是一个相当深思熟虑的过程，对吧？这就是它的大致样子。这是一种地图，在探索阶段我们的想象力非常不受约束。我们开始验证一些概念，将这些想法不断收紧、再收紧，然后我们实际上开始构建产品，发布它，然后迭代，对吧？这是最简单的理解方式。我将带你们了解每个步骤。在探索阶段，它非常狂野。它充满想象力。我们思考世界发展的愿景，我们的战略是什么，品牌代表什么。我们思考很多你们在这里做的事情。你们在梦想，在想象，如何颠覆，未来会是什么样子？对吧？有时它有点像科学项目，我们以这种方式谈论它，对吧，我们确实从灵感和洞察中构建。这就是一种原始的创造力。我们想要创造，我们努力创造，

We want to create a form where that's okay, because a lot of times in companies, that gets lost. When we bring it to early validation, I always say that everyone doing this stuff has to take those concepts and prove them like a PhD thesis. You have your conclusions, you've done empirical data collection, and you start to present where you see it going and what it's going to do. You outline the story. Once we've signed off on that phase and believe the theory is right, we start to go into a concepting phase where we really think about the experience and what's possible. This is another interesting opportunity for innovation at a more specific level of how this thing will come to life, what it is, how we would sell that experience, and how we would tell that story. Then we decide that it's a program and it goes into a heavy planning phase where we start to look at and say we're doing this and we've gotta ship it. There is no turning back. We examine the trade-offs between all the creativity and ideas we want versus what the physics dictates, such as battery power and all the different constraints we have. We start making those trade-offs and look at how we pull that together. Then we move into a development phase where it's a hand off between various stages.

我们想要创造一种允许这种情况存在的形式，因为在公司中很多时候这一点会被忽视。当我们进行早期验证时，我总是说，每个做这些事情的人现在都必须把这些概念拿出来证明，就像完成博士论文一样。你有自己的结论，你已经完成了实证数据收集，然后你开始展示你认为它会如何发展以及它将实现什么。你勾勒出整个故事。一旦我们批准了这个阶段并认为理论是正确的，我们就开始进入概念化阶段，在这个阶段我们真正思考体验和可能性。这是在更具体的层面上实现创新的另一个有趣机会，包括这个东西将如何实现、它是什么、我们将如何销售这种体验以及如何讲述这个故事。然后我们决定这是一个项目，它进入了一个密集的规划阶段，在这个阶段我们开始审视并说我们要做这个，我们必须交付它。没有回头路可走。我们审视所有我们想要的创造力和想法与物理规律所规定的之间的权衡，比如电池功率和我们所有的不同限制条件。我们开始进行这些权衡，并研究如何将它们整合在一起。然后我们进入开发阶段，这是不同阶段之间的交接过程。

You're solving problems as you implement this, and you launch it and you learn. You see what users think, and then you start to think about where this stands in that experience continuum that you've been imagining where the world's going to go. What have we achieved? What haven't we achieved? What have we learned from our users? How does that change what we're thinking? Then we start right over again. So that's the broadest way to think about it.

在实施过程中解决问题，发布产品并从中学习。了解用户的想法，然后开始思考这个产品在你设想的世界发展方向的体验连续体中处于什么位置。我们取得了什么成就？还有什么没有实现？我们从用户那里学到了什么？这些如何改变我们的想法？然后我们重新开始。这是最宏观的思考方式。

It's a little bit like an angel investment, right? Would I give this guy 50 grand to go explore this and see if there's a there there, is there something to do. And our CTO is the sort of final decision maker. He gets to sort of pick those things internally and say, you know what I like all the feedback. This is the one I want to go chase down and see what happens, right? So then we get into this validation phase, and this is where it starts to get really interesting. Still led by R&D, but they're really poking at it and they're saying, how does this work? We have these leadership meetings with the broader cross-functional team. I have to show results. I have to go through a scientific process to outline why this works. Why is it going to happen. And you'll hear. This is really when we start formulating a really important tool that we use in the company, which is what we call why's. Defining the why are we doing this? Why does this exist? What problem does it solve? I'm going to come back to that in a minute, right? And so at this point, it's still an R&D lead. But this is when a lot of our industrial design team, you have Bahar and a few project guys. They come in, they start to think about how can I pull this concept into something physical that's hardware, and how is that going to interact with the rest of the pieces of the system? Our product experience team is still also driving a lot of the core values and what the storyboarding is. But it starts to become a lot more real, and this is when we start thinking about.

这有点像天使投资，对吧？我会给这个人五万美元去探索这个想法，看看是否真的有价值，是否有事情可做。我们的首席技术官是最终决策者。他负责在内部挑选这些项目并说，我喜欢所有的反馈。但这是我想去追求并看看会发生什么的那一个，对吧？然后我们进入验证阶段，这时开始变得真正有趣。仍然由研发部门主导，但他们真正深入探究并询问：这是如何运作的？我们与更广泛的跨职能团队举行领导会议。我必须展示结果。我必须通过科学流程来概述为什么这能成功。为什么会发生。你会听到。这正是我们开始制定公司使用的重要工具的时候，我们称之为"原因"。定义我们为什么要这样做？它为什么存在？它解决了什么问题？我稍后会再详细讨论这个，对吧？所以在这个阶段，仍然是研发主导。但这时我们的工业设计团队，包括巴哈尔和几个项目人员，开始参与进来。他们开始思考如何将这个概念转化为硬件的实体形式，以及它将如何与系统的其他部分交互？我们的产品体验团队仍然在推动很多核心价值和故事板设计。但这开始变得更加真实，这时我们开始考虑。

And, and really various functional teams in this guy 50 grand? How would we build this? You know, how expensive is it going to be, what's the budget going to be, etc, right? And at that point, right, we start to really validate, can we actually build it? Or do we have to wait three years for batteries to be there, or do we have to wait for this other innovation to happen, or do we have to wait from a budget perspective, or whatever it is. Is there a business viability, and then we start to, really start to sketch kind of briefs. And this is where I come in, and make the final decision on, okay, I think this is the, there's really a there there. We can now take this to the next level and get it into a play. And then we go into the concept phase, right?

而且，各个功能团队真的会问：这家伙值五万吗？我们该怎么构建这个产品？你知道，成本会有多高，预算会是多少，等等，对吧？在那个时候，我们开始真正验证：我们能否实际构建它？还是我们必须等待三年让电池技术成熟，或者等待其他创新出现，或者从预算角度等待，无论是什么原因。是否存在商业可行性，然后我们开始真正起草各种简报。这就是我介入的地方，并做出最终决定：好的，我认为这个确实有实质内容。我们现在可以将其提升到下一个层次，并付诸实施。然后我们进入概念阶段，对吧？

And this is now when the responsibility shifts from the R&D folks to what we call product experience team. And the way we think about product experience in Jawbone is sort of what everyone thinks of this sort of conventional design. So from industrial design to software design to audio design to anything that touches that experience. We have writers on that team, story tellers, we have ID people like Eve who are genius creatives. We have amazing app level designers, graphic designers, everything. It's all in one team, and we call that product experience. And their job is sort of from bits to atoms and back and all the way through to unify as one organization.

现在责任从研发人员转移到我们称之为产品体验团队的时候了。在 Jawbone，我们对产品体验的理解类似于大家对传统设计的认知。从工业设计到软件设计，再到音频设计，以及任何涉及用户体验的方面。这个团队有撰稿人、故事讲述者，有像 Eve 这样的工业设计师，他们都是天才创意人员。我们有出色的应用级设计师、平面设计师等各类人才。所有这些都在一个团队中，我们称之为产品体验。他们的工作是从数字到实体再返回，并始终作为一个统一组织来运作。

And that's when they sort of take a hold of this, and they start to really kind of work out what is, and this is what we call when you're starting to really drive the why's, right? Thinking about what's possible, there's a lot of innovation and creativity now in the actual implementation of how we're going to build and create a product. And we start to say like, what are the most important things in that product? What are the most important problems we're going to solve? We call them hero experiences, right? What are we going to do? How, what is the bar that will be acceptable, etc, right. And at this point we start to really resolve what we call these why's, which I'll show you again in a minute. And why is that different from what anyone else has done from the competition from the category. And then what is, where does it go, right. It's we don't like to do just one off things, we have to see a broader vision. And this is part of that creation experience, is we look at where do we think the world is moving, and how is this thing going to be a stepping-stone to that ultimate end vision. And that's where the road map starts to get fleshed out. I have the ability here to come in and sort of be the final decision maker with my team and say, yep, we're going to move this to this next phase. And here is also where we look at some of these things. When I get into some of the specific examples we have fast track programs, right. So we took, for example, the Jambox when we were in this phase and we said, we're not going to go through that phase, we're going to go straight into the development process, right. Because we want to get this thing out, we want to test it and market it, and move really quickly. So we have the ability to sort of circumvent our own process now and say like, okay let's go, let's go really rapid and fast track it, and recalibrate the go to market.

就在这个时候，他们开始掌握这个流程，并真正开始思考那些本质问题，这就是我们所说的开始深入探究"为什么"的阶段。思考各种可能性，在实际的产品构建和创造实施过程中，现在充满了大量的创新和创造力。我们开始思考：这个产品中最重要的要素是什么？我们要解决的最关键问题是什么？我们称之为核心体验，对吧？我们要做什么？标准是什么，什么样的标准是可以接受的等等。在这个阶段，我们开始真正解决这些"为什么"的问题，我稍后会再次展示。为什么我们的做法与竞争对手和行业内的其他人都不同？然后是什么，它将走向何方。我们不喜欢做一次性的事情，我们必须看到更广阔的愿景。这是创造体验的一部分，我们会观察我们认为世界正在向哪个方向发展，以及这个产品如何成为实现最终愿景的垫脚石。这就是路线图开始具体化的地方。我在这里有能力与团队一起成为最终决策者，说：是的，我们将把这个推进到下一个阶段。这里也是我们审视其中一些事项的地方。当我谈到一些具体例子时，我们有快速通道项目。例如，当我们处于这个阶段时，我们拿 Jambox 为例，我们说我们不会经历那个阶段，而是直接进入开发流程。因为我们想要推出这个产品，我们想要测试它并在市场上推广，行动要非常迅速。所以我们有能力绕过自己的流程，说：好的，让我们行动，让我们快速推进并采用快速通道，重新调整上市策略。

So this is when we, after this stage now, it shifts from that product experience team to our product managers, who are really defining the business plan. When's it going to launch? When's it going to get into the retail calendar? When do, what is the software release cycle? Really prototyping actually starting to feel it and you're starting to make as I call a lot of those trade offs. Where like, okay we wanted to build this, we can't do that, but here's what we can do. We want to be this way we have to, you know, we want these functional experiences, but we're going to sacrifice battery life. Whatever it is, that's where we start to really kind of pool those decisions and start looking at it. And it's really a big juggling act frankly at that point right. And so the product guys are driving that. And that's when again you know we sort of look at and synthesize all of what we've put together and we say okay, does it actually cross enough things off our list? Does it meet that minimum viability, right? Because we always start with a very big wish list of what's possible and what we can do. And then we start to whittle it down and say, is this cross enough of the value threshold that we think that it's worth pursuing? And now can we actually move it into the development phase where again product management continues to lead it, but now you're starting to really get deep. And this is where engineering comes in and is really starting to sign off on like we can build it, here's a time schedule and how we ship. And then again, product team is looking at how should we go deeper on this.

在这个阶段之后，工作从产品体验团队转移到我们的产品经理手中，他们负责制定具体的商业计划。产品何时发布？何时进入零售日程？软件发布周期如何安排？通过实际原型制作开始感受产品，并开始做出我所说的各种权衡取舍。比如，我们原本想开发这个功能，但无法实现，不过我们可以做这些替代方案。我们想要实现这些功能体验，但需要牺牲电池续航。无论具体是什么，这时我们开始汇集这些决策并进行审视。坦白说，这确实是一个复杂的平衡过程。产品团队负责推动这一阶段。这时我们会重新审视并整合所有已完成的成果，评估是否满足了清单上的足够多要求。是否达到了最低可行性标准？因为我们总是从一个包含各种可能性和可行方案的长长愿望清单开始，然后逐步精简，判断是否跨越了价值门槛，值得继续推进。现在能否真正进入开发阶段，在这个阶段产品管理继续主导，但开始深入细节。这时工程团队介入，确认我们能够构建产品，制定时间表和交付计划。产品团队则继续研究如何在这方面深入发展。

And recalibrate the go-to-market possibilities. How can we increase engagement with a little innovations? Or the tuning, what are all the things that we need to do to sort of make that? You know one of the things that we've been fortunate to have is a lot of wonderful response to the products that we've built. We take a lot of care and time and detail really in this development and concepting phase around little details that create these magical experiences. So for example when we turn on Jambox, we have this pretty cool sound design that took months to come up with the right audio tuning. We worked with a lot of different choreographers to create that sound, but every time someone turns it on I see them smile and they laugh. The feel of the rubber prototyping and there's one manufacturer in world that was able to make the rubber at the quality and durometer that we wanted and the colors that we wanted for the first Jambox. So all of those little magical details how to resolve, even in software. When we had the first up and when it plugged in and your sleep graph showed up. Even just the animations of how the bars would show up and the way the cards would flow in and out. That was a detail that we had thought about: how's this going to interact, how's the user going to experience that, how're they going to feel it? So a lot of that kind of stuff happens even at this stage where you sign off on a program it's going. But you're making those kinds of decisions all the way through and you're trading them off and you're doing it in the context of this bigger picture.

重新调整市场推广的可能性。我们如何通过微创新来提高用户参与度？或者说调整，我们需要做哪些事情来实现这个目标？我们很幸运的一点是，我们打造的产品获得了大量积极反馈。在开发和概念阶段，我们投入了大量心血、时间和精力来打磨那些创造神奇体验的微小细节。例如当我们启动 Jambox 时，我们设计了非常酷的音效，这花费了数月时间才完成精准的音频调校。我们与众多编舞师合作创造这个声音，但每次有人启动它时，我都能看到他们露出微笑并发出笑声。橡胶原型的手感，世界上只有一家制造商能够按照我们要求的质量和硬度计制造出我们为第一代 Jambox 想要的橡胶材质和颜色。所有这些神奇的小细节如何解决，即使在软件中也是如此。当我们首次启动并插入设备时，您的睡眠图表就会显示出来。甚至只是柱状图的显示动画，以及卡片的流入流出方式。这是我们深思熟虑的细节：这将如何交互，用户将如何体验，他们将如何感受？因此，即使在项目即将获批的这个阶段，仍然会发生大量此类决策。但您需要全程做出这些决策，进行权衡取舍，并在更宏观的背景下完成这些工作。

So continued innovation is an opportunity to keep refining and keep doing all that stuff. So how do we think about it at a broader level? What is the framework for how we think about these signature experiences? Well, we do start with these "whys", which is that articulation of a problem that we're solving. And then the themes around how these become actionable concepts. And then what we do is we build these cross-functional pods that take a person from the product experience team, a person from hardware engineering, a person from software engineering, a person from the data team, and we put them together. This is the pod that owns that theme or that track, and they continue to build that out against the hero features and inside features into how we put that together. So I'm going to go into more specifics around what we call these "whys", because this is where I spend a lot of my time really asking a question. And what it does is it serves as a really interesting framework for us to be able to come back and say, "Hey, do we meet those questions that we ask? Does this thing actually do it?" And it serves also as a really good guide post for a lot of our creativity and a lot of our innovation so that it's not unbridled. So it really comes down to a very simple question for us: What is the user problem that we solve through this experience, whether it's in hardware, software, data, platform, whatever it is? That once we solve it, people can't live without it.

因此，持续创新是一个不断优化、持续完善所有工作的机会。那么我们在更宏观的层面该如何思考这个问题？我们思考这些标志性体验的框架是什么？实际上，我们确实从这些"为什么"开始，即对我们正在解决的问题进行清晰阐述。然后是围绕这些如何转化为可执行概念的主题。接下来我们会组建跨职能小组，这些小组包括来自产品体验团队、硬件工程、软件工程和数据团队的成员，我们将他们聚集在一起。这个小组负责该主题或方向，他们持续围绕核心功能和内部功能进行构建，整合我们的工作方式。现在我将更具体地探讨我们称之为"为什么"的内容，因为这是我花费大量时间真正提出问题的领域。它的作用是作为一个非常有趣的框架，让我们能够回顾并询问："我们是否达到了我们提出的那些问题？这个东西真的做到了吗？"它同时也为我们的大量创造力和创新提供了很好的指导标杆，确保创新不是无拘无束的。所以对我们来说，这实际上归结为一个非常简单的问题：我们通过这种体验（无论是在硬件、软件、数据、平台还是其他任何方面）解决的用户问题是什么？一旦我们解决了这个问题，人们就无法离开它。

They may have an absolutely burning need to solve this problem, and they can't find a solution. Or it's like things that once you have them, you never thought you needed them, but now you can't live without them. The Jambox is a great example of that. We talked to some people when we were thinking about making that product, and it was interesting. When we launched the Jambox in the fall of 2010, the market for wireless speakers as a percentage of the overall speaker market was 0%. Last Christmas, which was Christmas of 2013, it was 78% of the market. So in a few years we were able to transform this entire industry that had been around since the 50s and 60s. If I had gone out and asked a bunch of people who wants a $199 speaker for their mobile phone, I guarantee you that in that focus group 0% of those people would have said they want that thing or need it or would be willing to pay for it. But when we did it, it transformed an industry. This is where these why's become super important, focusing on what you're doing. I'll go through one example in the audio space which is the Jambox example, and then I'll take you through how we did it with UP24. It starts with what we call our category strategy, and this is the sort of experience framework.

他们可能迫切需要解决这个问题，却找不到解决方案。或者就像那些你拥有之前从未想过需要，但拥有后就离不开的东西。Jambox 就是一个很好的例子。我们在考虑开发这个产品时与一些人交谈过，这很有趣。当我们在 2010 年秋季推出 Jambox 时，无线音箱在整个音箱市场中的占比为 0%。到 2013 年圣诞节时，这个比例达到了 78%。所以在几年时间里，我们彻底改变了这个自五六十年代就存在的行业。如果我当时出去问一群人，谁想要一个 199 美元的手机音箱，我保证在那个焦点小组中，0%的人会说他们想要或需要这个东西，或者愿意为此付费。但当我们真正推出后，它改变了整个行业。这就是为什么这些"为什么"变得如此重要，要真正专注于你正在做的事情。我将通过音频领域的一个例子来说明，就是 Jambox 的例子，然后我会带你们了解我们是如何在 UP24 上实现这一点的。这始于我们所谓的品类战略，这是一种体验框架。

Our view was that all of your content and media experiences are now on your phone, no longer on your iPad, iPod, or your computer. We need a different way to interact with it that needs to be as mobile, as portable, and as high quality. That was our fundamental thinking. We said that experience needs to be seamless across time and space - anywhere, in different cars, while traveling, in and out of your house, around the house. That was fundamentally what we were doing, and we said that's the whole point of why this category should exist. That was the human problem. Then we asked what's in it for Jawbone, why should we do this? Considering the broader macro context of the internet of things, this was our entry into your home. While everybody talks about all these new connected things in your house like lights, thermostats, cable boxes, fridges, and smoke alarms, media is still the killer app in your house where we sell millions and millions of units. We said speakers can be our entry into that world around you, and it can be the hub of things we want to do from a software and service perspective in your home. There's this interesting strategy both at solving user problems and understanding why it matters to Jawbone. These two have to go together because we're not in a philanthropic, not-for-profit industry, and if you do this well, it allows you to keep doing great products and keep moving forward.

我们的观点是，您所有的内容和媒体体验现在都在手机上，而不再在 iPad、iPod 或电脑上。我们需要一种不同的交互方式，这种方式需要同样移动、便携且高质量。这是我们的基本思路。我们表示这种体验需要在时间和空间上无缝衔接——无论身处何处，在不同的汽车中，旅行时，进出房屋，在房屋周围。这基本上就是我们在做的事情，我们认为这就是这个类别应该存在的全部意义。这是人类面临的问题。然后我们问这对 Jawbone 有什么好处，我们为什么要这样做？考虑到物联网更广泛的宏观背景，这是我们进入您家庭的入口。虽然大家都在谈论家中所有这些新的连接设备，如灯光、恒温器、有线电视盒、冰箱和烟雾报警器等，但媒体仍然是家中的杀手级应用，我们在这里销售了数百万台设备。我们认为扬声器可以成为我们进入您周围世界的入口，并且可以成为我们在家庭中从软件和服务角度想要做的事情的中心。这是一个有趣的策略，既要解决用户问题，又要理解它对 Jawbone 的重要性。这两者必须齐头并进，因为我们不是慈善性、非营利性行业，而且如果做得好，这将使您能够继续开发优秀产品并不断前进。

It allows you to keep moving forward and doing interesting things. So that's sort of how we put that together. And then we built this sort of what we think the experience, what we call the experience continuum is. Where is it today, right? And when we started it was a Bluetooth speaker, right? That was the core enabling technology that allowed us to connect to stuff. Where do we think that it's going to go tomorrow? And then, what happens when we can dream in the future, right? And we start to really try to live in tomorrow and the future and the sort of thing about what we build today as a stepping stone to graduate users starting in one place, continue to move through that. And that gives us a view of how we also make these trade offs, right? Because we said, you know what, we're not going to put this into this product, but we got a spacer in the next one and we know that we can move users to that and they'll be ready for it, right? And that's a lot of the way we build stuff is we sort of define that experience continuum right? And then we do talk about this a lot. We don't think of ourselves as a hardware team or software team or data company or whatever it is. We think of ourselves as an experiences company, right? It's not just about that physical device or the feature, the object, it's about the system, it's about how the pieces come together. And so when we start to define these whys, they become the problem statement, and we say okay, how do we use a piece of hardware. How do we use the service in the cloud?

它让你能够持续前进，做有趣的事情。这就是我们整合这些要素的方式。然后我们构建了这种我们称之为体验连续体的概念。它现在处于什么位置？当我们开始时，它只是一个蓝牙音箱，对吧？这是核心的使能技术，让我们能够连接各种设备。我们认为它明天将走向何方？然后，当我们能够梦想未来时会发生什么？我们开始真正尝试生活在明天和未来，将今天构建的东西作为用户从一个起点开始、持续前进的垫脚石。这让我们能够看清如何做出这些权衡，对吧？因为我们说过，我们不会把这个功能放进这个产品，但在下一个产品中预留了空间，我们知道可以将用户引导到那里，他们会为此做好准备，对吧？这就是我们构建产品的主要方式，我们定义了这种体验连续体。我们经常讨论这一点。我们不认为自己是硬件团队、软件团队或数据公司。我们认为自己是一家体验公司，对吧？不仅仅是关于物理设备、功能或物体，而是关于整个系统，关于各个部分如何协同工作。所以当我们开始定义这些"为什么"时，它们就变成了问题陈述，我们会说：我们如何使用硬件？我们如何使用云服务？

How do we use an application, a sound, a button to solve this user experience problem that we have? And what's the right distribution across that system of where you should attack the problem? And where do we need to innovate? And where do we need to pull together? So that's a big part of the thinking. It helps us do it. When we think about these experiences, we say it's really around the context of why it's magical to the user. And then like I said, the system is a flagship, and then it has to go to the level of emotional connection, where you feel without it you're lost. Like, I'm going to go back home and get it if I don't have it. And so those are the kind of principles that govern all these things. And we have to keep asking ourselves those questions, is it doing that? So we pull this all together in experience framework. This becomes essentially a brief for your engineering team and your design team, and all the people that work on this in the company. That they can go back to and say, what are we doing, and why are we doing it? And how does that work? And then how do we create against that? And then we have a sort of whole process. Blueberry is one of the internal code names. But the user experience process starts with a better resource, so we do actually listen to users and talk to them. But we talk to them in a very specific way. Start looking for those key insights. We concept them and then we start to build.

我们如何使用应用程序、声音、按钮来解决我们面临的用户体验问题？在这个系统中，我们应该在哪些地方解决问题才是正确的分配？我们需要在哪些方面创新？我们需要在哪些方面协同合作？这是思考中很重要的一部分。它帮助我们完成这件事。当我们思考这些体验时，我们说这实际上关乎于为什么它对用户来说是神奇的背景。然后就像我说的，系统是一个旗舰产品，它必须达到情感连接的层面，让你感觉没有它就会迷失。就像，如果我没有它，我会回家去拿。这些就是支配所有这些事情的原则。我们必须不断问自己这些问题，它是否做到了这一点？因此我们将所有这些整合到体验框架中。这本质上成为了给你的工程团队和设计团队，以及公司里所有从事这项工作的人的简报。他们可以回过头来说，我们在做什么，我们为什么要这样做？这是如何运作的？然后我们如何基于此进行创造？然后我们有一个完整的过程。蓝莓是内部代号之一。但用户体验过程始于更好的资源，所以我们确实会倾听用户并与他们交谈。但我们以非常具体的方式与他们交谈。开始寻找那些关键洞察。我们对它们进行概念化，然后开始构建。

This is why we go to find those lists of consumer problems. The principles, how do we think about approaching that? What are the solutions? And then what's required in the product to make that happen.

这就是为什么我们要去寻找那些消费者问题清单。原则是什么？我们该如何思考解决这些问题的方法？有哪些解决方案？然后产品需要具备什么条件来实现这些目标。

How do they behave? How do they live? And you say to them, if you had something that allowed you to take a great example like iPod. If you said to somebody, if you could put a thousand songs in your pocket and take them anywhere, that's cool. Not do you want a digital portable music player. So again it's at a price that was more than your phone. So you have to separate what are questions that you can ask that are going to help make you smarter about your thesis versus trying to get somebody to validate it for you. And I think that's the real separation. No one's going to tell you what to build. If they do then they should do it, and not you. And so you're the one who's making that decision. You've got the thesis, you've got the creative idea, you've got the innovation. You gotta use these people to help you make it better and to refine your thinking. That's the difference. Make sense?

他们的行为方式如何？他们的生活方式怎样？你会对他们说，如果你拥有像 iPod 这样的绝佳范例。如果你对某人说，如果你能把一千首歌放进口袋随身携带，那很酷。而不是问你是否想要一个数字便携音乐播放器。再说它的价格比你的手机还贵。所以你必须区分哪些问题能让你对自己的论点更明智，而不是试图让别人为你验证它。我认为这才是真正的区别。没有人会告诉你该构建什么。如果他们知道，那应该由他们来做，而不是你。所以你是做决定的人。你有了论点，有了创意想法，有了创新。你要利用这些人来帮助你改进和完善你的思路。这就是区别。明白了吗？

Okay. So, I'm going to switch over to some Up24, which is the product that we've had on the market, our wireless products for health tracking. And the whys of Up24 are really simple, right? Well, first of all, let me start with the whys for Up. The idea there was there's so much that we know about the world today, through Twitter, Facebook, social media, access to the internet, Google, et cetera, but we know nothing about ourselves. We have no idea why some days I sleep eight hours and feel terrible some days I sleep three and feel awesome. Like I just have no idea, right? And so our thought was: could we take a lot of this sensor technology, help people understand more about themselves and start to then make better decisions about how they live better. So that was the first product.

This was the second product we said: okay, great, now that we have wireless connectivity, it's not just about Bluetooth or wireless, it's about the fact that I can use that real time flow of information to understand what's happening with me, and go, and take action on it, right? I can get the data in a more meaningful, relevant, contextually important way at the moment that it matters. I can also get back guidance in a structured way that can help me go do things. And I want that ongoing encouragement, because everybody, you know, knows that they want to be better, but they fall down or do whatever. And they want a fluid way to interact with this. So this is what we're sort of building in Up24, right?

We had this very crisp set of five things that were the whys of why we're building this product and why we're doing it. And our point of view was that it was going to, we had this sort of fundamental narrative going, going back to the experience framework where we said everything we do in UP is about helping people track and understand themselves, track themselves, understand, which is taking all that data and converting it into knowledge. And then the third part was act, so track, understand, and act. That is our narrative for everything we do in the kind of wearable health space, fundamental. And it will be for the entirety of what we do. It's sort of help people get more information on results.

好的。现在我要转向介绍 Up24，这是我们已经在市场上推出的产品，我们的无线健康追踪产品。Up24 的设计理念其实很简单，对吧？首先，让我从 Up 的设计理念说起。当时的想法是，通过 Twitter、Facebook、社交媒体、互联网接入、谷歌等等，我们对当今世界了解甚多，但对自己却一无所知。我们不知道为什么有些天我睡了八小时却感觉糟糕，有些天只睡三小时却感觉棒极了。就像我完全不知道原因，对吧？因此我们的想法是：能否利用大量传感器技术，帮助人们更好地了解自己，然后开始就如何更好地生活做出更明智的决定。这就是我们的第一个产品。

这是我们的第二个产品，我们说：好的，太棒了，既然我们有了无线连接，这不仅仅是蓝牙或无线技术的问题，而是关于我能够利用实时信息流来了解自身状况，并据此采取行动，对吧？我可以在关键时刻以更有意义、更相关、更具情境重要性的方式获取数据。我还能以结构化的方式获得指导，帮助我去完成事情。而且我想要持续不断的鼓励，因为每个人都知道自己想要变得更好，但他们会跌倒或做出其他事情。他们希望以流畅的方式与之互动。这就是我们在 Up24 中构建的内容，对吧？

我们有一个非常清晰的五点理念，说明了我们为什么要构建这个产品以及为什么要这样做。我们的观点是，这将会延续我们一直以来的基本叙事，回到体验框架，我们在那里说过，我们在 UP 所做的一切都是为了帮助人们追踪和理解自己，追踪自身，理解，也就是将所有数据转化为知识。然后第三部分是行动，所以就是追踪、理解和行动。这是我们在可穿戴健康领域所做一切的基本叙事。而且这将贯穿我们所有的工作。这就像是帮助人们获得更多关于结果的信息。

It's sort of, help people get more information on results. Data is great, understanding is better, convert that into things that they can have, create real knowledge that they can then take action on. So anything that we can do to keep the device on, get more information, help them be engaged and then find ways of guiding that behavior was really, really interesting and this is the sort of framework for the system.

这实际上是帮助人们从结果中获取更多信息。数据很好，理解更好，将其转化为他们能够拥有的东西，创造他们能够据此采取行动的真实知识。因此，我们能够做的任何事情——保持设备开启、获取更多信息、帮助他们参与其中，然后找到引导这种行为的方式——都非常有趣，这就是系统的框架。

And then you can start to think about working out or doing whatever, right? And that's what we've built. That's a lot of infrastructure to create that experience, but that's how we build software. That's how we build hardware. That's how we build the whole system. And then often, we will talk about different kinds of users and what they care about, and what we think our user base is made of. You know, who's more into weight loss, who wants social acceptance, who are people who are vain that just want to look better, and why - it's true. So there are lots of different things. And there are people who have medical reasons for using our product. We design different kinds of experiences, right? And we think about using platforms like phones and ways to push notifications as part of the system. We think of notifications as a tool for behavior change, right? And we actually start to map out these things. What is a smart action? Is it real time? Is it customizable? Does it feel progressive? Does it help me? Is it really tailored to me? Right? And then for this particular type of user, we go out and storyboard, and these storyboards go to our design engineering teams. We work together and they actually start to build off of this. And what this does for us is it creates a nice set of constraints. My experience has been constraints are really great because they serve as opportunities to resolve, to refine, to simplify and push you to find the right answer.

然后你可以开始考虑锻炼或做其他事情，对吧？这就是我们所构建的。为了创造这种体验需要大量基础设施，但这就是我们构建软件的方式。这就是我们构建硬件的方式。这就是我们构建整个系统的方式。然后我们经常会讨论不同类型的用户以及他们关心什么，我们认为用户群体由哪些人组成。你知道，谁更关注减肥，谁想要社会认可，谁是那些虚荣只想看起来更好的人，以及为什么——这是真的。所以有很多不同的情况。还有一些人使用我们的产品是出于医疗原因。我们设计不同类型的体验，对吧？我们考虑使用手机等平台和推送通知的方式作为系统的一部分。我们将通知视为行为改变的工具，对吧？我们实际上开始规划这些事情。什么是智能行动？它是实时的吗？它是可定制的吗？它是否感觉是渐进的？它对我有帮助吗？它是否真的为我量身定制？对吧？然后针对这种特定类型的用户，我们会进行故事板设计，这些故事板会交给我们的设计工程团队。我们一起合作，他们实际上开始基于此进行构建。这对我们来说创造了一套很好的约束条件。我的经验是约束条件非常好，因为它们作为解决问题的机会，完善、简化并推动你找到正确的答案。

That will solve the user problem in the simplest way, right? And so we create a lot of those constraints around what we're doing. This is the sort of storyboarding for getting someone to the goal and how they do it and what we use in real time. And then we put in sort of the secondary experiences, right? Which is if we can do this and we can fit it in, it's not too cluttered or confusing we'll put it in. So that's a little bit of a snapshot into how we build. We've few minutes left so I'd love to answer any questions.

这将以最简单的方式解决用户问题，对吧？因此我们在工作中设置了很多这样的约束条件。这是一种故事板设计方法，用于帮助用户达成目标，包括他们如何操作以及我们在实时环境中使用的工具。然后我们会加入一些次要体验，对吧？也就是说如果我们能做到这一点并且能够融入其中，不会显得过于杂乱或令人困惑，我们就会加入。这就是我们构建方式的简要概述。我们还剩几分钟时间，我很乐意回答任何问题。

Yeah the person's great. When it's a small team, it's really easy because you guys are all sitting around the table. You're looking at each other. You're making those decisions in real time. As you get bigger and a larger company, you have to force a lot of communication where everyone is in a room and that person says, what if you build, if you were constraining this way. Then I can't get the quality spec that you need me to make. And this guy's going to say well, if you do that, and you give me that much space, then I can't fit all the algorithms in at the battery performance that you want. And so when you start to look across the system, you start to see everyone has to share what their pains are. And they actually don't understand if I make this tradeoff, it's going to affect me over here. And so you have to put them all together in a room, and start hashing that. But what's on the board and on the walls, and on everywhere, is what are we trying to do? And does that tradeoff still meet it, right? Across all those different silos. Because everyone's thinking about the tradeoffs in their area and they know what they need to accomplish, right? But again, it is how does that affect the whole thing. We just went through this with three, which is a product we are shipping in a couple of weeks that sort of defined the next wave of what is happening in the wearable space on the health tracking side. We invented a totally new sensing system, right? There was raw science that had been developed that we prioritized really fast, and even just trade offs on what the electrode materials were. How it affects reliability, sourcing, signal performance.

这个人很棒。当团队规模较小时，事情很简单，因为大家都围坐在桌边。你们互相看着对方，实时做出决策。随着公司规模扩大，你必须强制进行大量沟通，让所有人聚在一个房间里，那个人会说，如果你这样构建，这样限制的话，我就无法达到你要求我实现的质量规格。另一个人会说，如果你那样做，给我那么大的空间，我就无法在你想要的电池性能下容纳所有算法。因此当你开始审视整个系统时，你会发现每个人都必须分享他们的痛点。他们实际上并不明白，如果我做出这个权衡，会在这里影响到我。所以你必须把所有人聚集在一个房间里，开始详细讨论。但写在白板上、墙上和所有地方的是：我们想要实现什么？这个权衡是否仍然符合目标？跨越所有这些不同的孤岛。因为每个人都在考虑自己领域的权衡，他们知道自己需要完成什么。但再次强调，关键在于这如何影响整体。我们刚刚在 Three 产品上经历了这个过程，这是我们几周后将要发货的产品，它在某种程度上定义了健康追踪领域可穿戴设备的下一个浪潮。我们发明了一个全新的传感系统。有一些原始科学已经被开发出来，我们非常快速地确定了优先级，甚至只是在电极材料选择上的权衡。它如何影响可靠性、采购和信号性能。

And they just, these guys weren't talking to each other. We had to get in a room and do daily calls for three hours, where they're going through each of their things. It's tedious, but we're figuring it out. We knock it down. So it's a little when you're small, it's really easy because you're just, "Sure I'll look at it." But you have to always have that definition of what you're trying to do across the system, and that's why a lot of what I was talking about was much higher level. What problem are we solving? Where's it go over time and then how do all these pieces inform it?

他们之间根本不沟通。我们不得不聚在一个房间里，每天进行三小时的通话，逐一讨论各自的事项。这很繁琐，但我们在逐步解决。我们将其分解。所以当你规模较小时，事情确实很容易，因为你会说"好的，我来看看"。但你必须始终明确在整个系统中要实现的目标，这就是为什么我谈到的很多内容都是更高层次的。我们要解决什么问题？随着时间的推移它会如何发展？所有这些部分如何为其提供信息？

If a startup wants to build a system eventually, should it start focusing on one small thing or should it start looking at systems itself and how to do them altogether? I think system thinking is a way, it's a mindset. It's not actually a system like the simple systems, there are complex ones. A plane is a very complex system, a car is a very complex system. There are other products we make that are more simpler, like a phone or an application, you should think of as a system. And how all the pieces work together: your storage, the fun and experience, what you're doing, the connectivity, that's all a system. And so that's more what we mean about system. For us, system is hardware, software and data but I think within even anything, there's always system things. And so it's more just thinking about how trade offs work across all the different pieces as they come together. Does that make sense?

如果一个初创公司最终想要构建一个系统，它应该从专注于一个小事开始，还是应该从一开始就着眼于系统本身以及如何整体构建？我认为系统思维是一种方式，一种心态。它实际上不是像简单系统那样的系统，还有复杂的系统。飞机是一个非常复杂的系统，汽车是一个非常复杂的系统。我们制造的其他产品，比如手机或应用程序，虽然更简单，但你也应该将其视为一个系统。所有部件如何协同工作：你的存储、乐趣和体验、你的操作、连接性，这都是一个系统。这就是我们所说的系统的含义。对我们来说，系统是硬件、软件和数据，但我认为即使在任何事物中，总是存在系统性的东西。所以更多的是思考当所有不同部分组合在一起时，权衡取舍如何发挥作用。这样理解对吗？
When you're small it's really easy because you just say, sure I'll look at it. But you have to always have that definition of what you're trying to do across the system, and that's why a lot of what I was talking about was much higher level. What problem are we solving? Where's it go over time and then how do all these pieces inform it?

当你规模小的时候，这很容易，因为你只需要说"好的，我来看看"。但你必须始终明确自己在整个系统中想要做什么，这就是为什么我谈论的很多内容都是更高层面的。我们要解决什么问题？它随时间如何发展？然后所有这些部分如何相互影响？

How do you get, I think system think is, is, it's a way, it's a mindset. Right? It's not actually a system like the simple systems, there are complex ones. You know, a plane is a very complex system, a car is a very complex system. There's other products we make that a more simpler phone as a complex an application, you should think of as a system. Right? And how all the pieces work together. Your storage you know, the fun and experience, what you're doing, the connectivity, that's all a system, right? And so that's more what we mean about system. Yes, for us, system is hardware, software and data but I think within even anything, there's always system things. And so it's more just thinking about how trade offs work across all the different pieces as they come together. Does that make sense?

系统思维是一种方式，是一种思维模式。对吧？它不是一个系统本身，有简单的系统，也有复杂的系统。飞机是一个非常复杂的系统，汽车是一个非常复杂的系统。我们制造的其他产品，比如手机或应用程序，都应该被视为一个系统。对吧？以及所有部分如何协同工作。你的存储、功能和体验、你正在做的事情、连接性，这些都是一个系统，对吧？这就是我们所说的系统的含义。是的，对我们来说，系统是硬件、软件和数据，但我认为在任何事物中，都存在系统性的东西。所以这更多的是思考当所有不同部分组合在一起时，如何在它们之间进行权衡。这样理解有意义吗？

Go ahead. I have a question. What's the decision making process between creating related products in the same space? Like for fitness tracking, there's different versions of Jambox. Use different versions of Jambox. And, you know, what goes into that? We do have a grand unified theory at some point around how these experiences come together. And what happens and it touches a little bit that point that I was making to you around a context engine, when you have things on your body that can make everything in the world around you smarter. Like if I know the emotional state of a user, I can tell Spotify what song it should play you on the jam box, right? I can tell the TV that you didn't like that commercial, they should fast forward to the next one. Or I can tell you not to watch Game of Thrones on a Sunday night, because you don't sleep well. Right? And so you start to see I'm serious, right? And so these pieces start to go together. And so we do think at that level, and then we start to say what are the building blocks that get there? Now how do we establish credibility? How do we establish a distribution system? How do we establish manufacturing scale? How do these pieces start to come together? So there is a grand unified vision for us. And we look at different categories and different categories have different dynamics. They move at different paces. They have different replacement cycles. A great example of this right now is what's going on with iPad and iPhone.

请讲。我有个问题。在同一领域创建相关产品时的决策过程是怎样的？比如在健身追踪方面，Jambox 有不同版本。使用不同版本的 Jambox。那么，这其中涉及哪些因素？我们确实有一个宏大的统一理论，关于这些体验如何结合在一起。这涉及到我之前向你提到的情境引擎的概念，当你身上佩戴的设备能让周围的一切变得更智能时。比如如果我知道用户的情绪状态，我可以告诉 Spotify 应该在 Jambox 上播放什么歌曲，对吧？我可以告诉电视你不喜欢那个广告，应该快进到下一个。或者我可以告诉你不要在周日晚上看《权力的游戏》，因为你睡眠不好。对吧？所以你可以看出我是认真的，对吧？这些部分开始相互配合。我们确实在那个层面上思考，然后我们开始思考实现这一目标需要哪些构建模块？我们如何建立可信度？我们如何建立分销系统？我们如何建立制造规模？这些部分如何开始整合？所以我们有一个宏大的统一愿景。我们审视不同的品类，不同的品类有不同的动态。它们以不同的速度发展。它们有不同的更新周期。目前一个很好的例子就是 iPad 和 iPhone 的情况。

They have different replacement cycles. A great example of this right now is what's going on with iPad and iPhone. We're all very used to replacing our phones every single year. iPads are not following that same trajectory, right? So the replacement cycle is different. The use case is different. The problem it's solving is different. So you've gotta adapt to that, right? You don't replace your nest every year. It's a 15 year install, so how do they build in that kind of a world and how do they think about.

它们有不同的更换周期。目前一个很好的例子就是 iPad 和 iPhone 的情况。我们都非常习惯每年更换手机。iPad 并没有遵循同样的轨迹，对吧？所以更换周期是不同的。使用场景是不同的。它解决的问题是不同的。所以你必须适应这一点，对吧？你不会每年更换你的智能家居设备。这是一个 15 年的安装周期，那么他们如何在这样的世界中构建产品，他们如何思考这个问题。

So it's just, you gotta think about your category, the replacement cycle, the usage, how these things come together and the dynamics are different. Right? Go ahead. First of all, how would you canvas this unique community of Babylon? Was it to face? And do you have this idea, or do you think the functionality is somewhat important? Which piece are you talking about? You're talking about the texture? The texture, yeah. Need a tech show. Succeeding at every job and product. Yeah, I know. A lot of that was developed by Eve and our design team. And sort of coming up with a branded look. So that you saw the icon and you knew what it was, right? Whether it's here or anything. So that was part of our mission. We wanted to convey a certain emotional quality, etcetera. Some people like it, some people don't. That's sort of the nature of design. But that was all part of the same process. Right? Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, so.

所以，你只需要考虑你的产品类别、更换周期、使用方式，这些因素如何结合在一起，以及动态变化是不同的。对吧？请继续。首先，你会如何调查巴比伦这个独特的社区？是为了面对吗？你是有了这个想法，还是认为功能有些重要？你在谈论哪一部分？你在说纹理吗？纹理，是的。需要一个技术展示。在每个工作和产品上都取得成功。是的，我知道。其中很多是由 Eve 和我们的设计团队开发的。某种程度上是创造一个有品牌特色的外观。这样当你看到图标时就知道它是什么，对吧？无论它在这里还是其他地方。所以这是我们使命的一部分。我们想要传达某种情感品质等等。有些人喜欢，有些人不喜欢。这就是设计的本质。但这些都是同一过程的一部分。对吧？请继续。抱歉。是的，所以。

So it's just, you gotta think about your category, the replacement cycle, the usage, how these things come together, and the dynamics are different. But when you get a certain product, how does your processing unnecessarily changed, and how do you take into account information you might have learned from? Like how does the framework and processes work? That's a good question. I'm actually going to go back to that. So the question was, it's sort of not on the initial product, but as you've launched the initial product, what happens to your thinking and how does that evolve the process? So I'm going to take it back to that slide that shows how we create and the process flow. So it's actually a great question. So this is you're starting something totally new from scratch, and you come out here and you do all this stuff and you get it to here. And then you learn a lot. In the first iteration of Up in 2011, it broke. It didn't work. So we had to actually go back to the drawing board. And so what that did here is we actually ended up telling these guys a bunch of things that they should be thinking about and sort of unlocking a lot of problems we had to solve. That they then started working on it at a different pace because sometimes this will take years to come to fruition. We can dream a lot faster than what's possible. And so even at core technology levels it censored. Batteries, chips, processing, what we can do with storage, like all that kind of stuff.

所以，你需要考虑你的产品类别、更换周期、使用方式，以及这些因素如何相互作用，其中的动态变化各不相同。但是当你获得某个产品时，你的处理流程如何不必要地改变，你如何考虑可能从中学到的信息？框架和流程是如何运作的？这是个好问题。我实际上要回到那个话题。问题是，这并不完全针对初始产品，而是当你推出初始产品后，你的思维方式会发生什么变化，以及这如何推动流程的演进？所以我要回到那张展示我们如何创建和流程的幻灯片。这确实是个很好的问题。当你从零开始全新的事物时，你来到这里完成所有工作并达到这个阶段。然后你会学到很多。在 2011 年 Up 的第一次迭代中，它失败了。它无法正常工作。所以我们不得不重新开始。这让我们最终告诉团队成员许多他们应该考虑的事项，并解决了很多需要解锁的问题。然后他们开始以不同的节奏工作，因为有时这需要数年才能取得成果。我们的梦想速度远超实际可能。即使在核心技术层面也是如此。电池、芯片、处理能力、我们在存储方面能做什么，所有这类事情。

Let's say, well you know what? If we have those are the problems that we're facing, what if we start running parallel threads to go fix that. And so we'll start doing some work here. They'll look at it in different parts of the process. So there's room for innovation in all these different things. But we may see something here that we say let's go straight into planning and development. We don't need to go all the way back, right? So we have the flexibility to sort of jump through and say we don't need to do these things. We know that. Like it wasn't a big struggle for us to know to go from a solution to plug in to go wireless. Like I wasn't concerned that we had to do a lot of concept evaluating. Right? So we can kind of skip through those steps if you know how to make those decisions. But this is more for us in a lot of ways is a way of kind of taking a lot of innovative spirit and creativity and giving it a very focused way to actually get out. Right? And so that's what we think about. We have the ability to sort of go back and forth and skip over steps as necessary.

假设我们面临这些问题，我们可以启动并行线程来解决它们。然后我们就会在这里开始做一些工作。他们会在流程的不同环节审视这些问题。所有这些不同方面都存在创新空间。但有时我们可能会发现某些情况，让我们决定直接进入规划开发阶段。我们不需要完全从头开始，对吧？所以我们有灵活性可以跳过某些环节，说我们不需要做这些事情。我们很清楚这一点。比如从有线解决方案转向无线方案对我们来说并不困难。我不担心我们需要进行大量的概念评估。对吧？所以如果你知道如何做决定，我们可以跳过那些步骤。但在很多方面，这更多是让我们能够汇集创新精神和创造力，并通过专注的方式将其实现。对吧？这就是我们的思考方式。我们能够根据需要来回切换并跳过某些步骤。

Go ahead. It changes our thinking around process and tools, and how we work together. We're about 500 people and we have a very remote setup. We've got an office in Sunnyvale, headquarters in San Francisco, offices in Seattle, Shanghai, Pittsburgh, and London. We have a very distributed team that poses a lot of interesting communication challenges, but also allows us to get where the talent is and where there are interesting people in specific areas that we're doing. I would say the single biggest thing that we continue to always try to get better at is communication between all these different people. Working in different ways and forcing them to sit at the table and say, "Here's what I'm working on, here's where my tradeoffs are, this is what I think it should affect you." Listening to other people and understanding it, and then remembering that we are building this system and here's what happens when all the pieces come together. How do we solve problems? But it's a lot of that, forcing that communication. I literally on UP3 have a daily call that's two and a half hours with the entire team, from materials, sourcing, manufacturing, design, sensor, firmware, mechanical engineering, all together. They all have to sit through each other's updates and understand what those tradeoffs are, and I sort of force that communication.

请继续。这改变了我们对流程、工具以及协作方式的思考。我们大约有 500 名员工，采用非常分散的工作模式。我们在森尼维尔设有办公室，旧金山设有总部，西雅图、上海、匹兹堡和伦敦都设有办事处。我们拥有一个高度分散的团队，这带来了许多有趣的沟通挑战，但也让我们能够接触到人才所在地和我们业务相关领域的优秀人才。我认为我们持续努力改进的最重要事项就是这些不同人员之间的沟通。通过不同工作方式，强制他们坐下来交流："这是我正在做的工作，这是我的权衡取舍，我认为这可能会对你产生影响。"倾听他人的意见并理解，然后记住我们正在构建这个系统，当所有部分组合在一起时会发生什么。我们如何解决问题？但这很大程度上依赖于强制沟通。在 UP3 项目上，我每天都会与整个团队进行两个半小时的电话会议，包括材料、采购、制造、设计、传感器、固件、机械工程等所有部门。他们必须听完彼此的进度更新，理解其中的权衡取舍，我某种程度上是在强制这种沟通。

So go ahead. Is that our team? Was that markets? I mean, I think a lot of it, some it's deliberate. You know, we sort of say obviously we build a lot of things in China, so we need to have a presence there and manage things. So at some point we got big enough that we wanted our own team on the ground. You know, we've expanded sales. I think we're in 56 countries globally, 100,000 points of sale. So that was, you know, we started in North America, we went to Europe, we went to Asia. Now we think a little bit differently about when we launch what geographies we go to. So it's some of it's deliberate and planned, some of it takes time. And again, it's part of that, you know, we want to be here, here's how we want to grow, we want to migrate our business this way. And then a lot of it is also opportunistic, right? There are markets that we've entered where you know, we had a really good partner. We had a really strong proposition. The culture was really well suited to what we were doing. You know, for UP, China's a huge market for us. We went in with Apple in Apple stores. And that was a great stamp of credibility and we sort of rode that wave. So again, but we knew we wanted to be in China, and that was a great entry point for us. So I think it depends on what you're doing specifically and what's appropriate for that situation.

请继续。那是我们的团队吗？是关于市场的问题吗？我的意思是，我认为很多情况下，有些是经过深思熟虑的。你知道，我们基本上认为显然我们在中国制造很多产品，所以我们需要在那里设立据点并进行管理。因此，当我们发展到一定规模时，就希望在当地建立自己的团队。你知道，我们已经扩展了销售网络。我认为我们的业务遍及全球 56 个国家，拥有 10 万个销售点。我们最初从北美起步，然后进入欧洲市场，再到亚洲市场。现在我们在考虑进入哪些地区市场时会采取不同的思路。所以，有些是经过精心策划和计划的，有些则需要时间积累。再次强调，这是整体战略的一部分，我们想要在这里发展，这就是我们期望的增长方式，我们希望以这种方式推进业务转型。同时也有很多是机会主义的，对吧？我们进入的某些市场是因为我们找到了非常优秀的合作伙伴。我们拥有非常强大的商业主张。当地文化与我们正在做的事情非常契合。你知道，对于 UP 来说，中国是我们巨大的市场。我们通过与苹果公司合作进入苹果专卖店。这为我们带来了极佳的信誉背书，我们顺势而为。所以再次强调，但我们知道我们想要进入中国市场，而这是一个绝佳的切入点。因此我认为这取决于你具体在做什么，以及什么适合当时的情况。

Yeah, who? How did you find the connections to each other? Go ahead. Why haven't you made any headphones? I mean, for us, like any category, I get asked about a lot of different things. Headphones is sort of one. First, when we come into a space, we want to blow it wide open and make sure we have a proposition that makes it better for the user than what's there today. We want to make it better by an order of magnitude or two orders of magnitude and do stuff. So sometimes the market's not ready. Sometimes the technology base isn't ready. Sometimes we're not ready. We don't have the right capabilities to synthesize and pull those pieces together. So it's a combination of factors, whatever the product or the category is. All right? All right, one more question. Go ahead, in the red sweater. Hi, for a hardware company or a system company, the product in recycle is always a headache. Sam mentioned one early faculty who had tried to run a hardware company and a software company. I was wondering, is there anything you can share there? Are you trying to run Jobo more like a closed software company to get user feedback along the way or along the process? Uh-huh. So I think the question was hardware companies are sort of hard to run, they're different from software companies. How are we trying to run Jobo, right? I would say there's no model for what we're trying to do. It's never been done before, so we feel like we're at the tip of the arrow. We're putting together disciplines that have never had to work side by side to create experiences.

是的，谁？你们是如何找到彼此之间的联系的？请说。为什么你们没有生产任何耳机？我的意思是，对我们来说，就像任何产品类别一样，我被问到很多不同的事情。耳机是其中之一。首先，当我们进入某个领域时，我们希望彻底打开局面，确保我们提出的方案能比现有产品更好地满足用户需求。我们希望通过一两个数量级的改进来实现这一点并做出成果。所以有时候市场还没准备好。有时候技术基础还没准备好。有时候我们自己还没准备好。我们没有足够的能力来整合这些要素。所以无论是什么产品或类别，这都是多种因素共同作用的结果。好吗？好的，还有一个问题。请说，穿红色毛衣的那位。你好，对于硬件公司或系统公司来说，产品回收始终是个令人头疼的问题。萨姆提到一位早期教员曾尝试同时经营硬件公司和软件公司。我想知道，在这方面您有什么可以分享的吗？您是否试图让 Jobo 更像一个封闭的软件公司，在整个过程或流程中获取用户反馈？嗯。所以我认为问题是硬件公司比较难经营，它们与软件公司不同。我们是如何尝试运营 Jobo 的，对吗？我想说我们正在做的事情没有先例可循。这是前所未有的，所以我们感觉自己是开拓者。我们正在整合那些从未需要并肩合作的学科来创造体验。

It's very painful sometimes. It's very fun. We try to take the best of everything. We try to take the best practices of what makes rapid software iteration, testing and development, deployment, and try to apply that to hardware. We try to take the resolution that you require in hardware and apply that to software design, because web software is very different than mobile software. And it turned out that building mobile software was actually a lot more like building hardware, where you actually had one shot and you had to get it right right out of the gate. So, we try to take the lessons from each place and make ourselves really good. And that's my job and that's the job of some of the other senior leadership is to look at those opportunities of how you take the best of everything and put it together. But I don't think there's ever been a company that's been great at, equally great at hardware or software data. And that's what we're trying to do.

有时候会很痛苦，有时候又很有趣。我们试图汲取一切事物的精华。我们努力借鉴那些能够实现快速软件迭代、测试、开发和部署的最佳实践，并尝试将其应用于硬件领域。我们试图将硬件所需的分辨率要求应用到软件设计中，因为网页软件与移动软件存在很大差异。事实证明，开发移动软件实际上更类似于制造硬件，因为你只有一次机会，必须从一开始就做到完美。因此，我们努力从各个领域汲取经验教训，让自己变得真正优秀。这就是我的职责，也是其他一些高层领导的职责——寻找如何博采众长并将其融会贯通的机会。但我认为从未有哪家公司能在硬件或软件数据方面都同样出色。而这正是我们努力追求的目标。
