A little bit about me: I'm a former YC founder. I've worked at startups basically my entire career, both small ones and large ones. Me and my team run YC's Work at a Startup, which is a hiring platform and a great way to find a job. We'll be touching upon that a little bit more in a bit. If you don't know about YC, we help startups get their early start. Just to name a few of the companies that have gone through YC: Dropbox with Ashton as one of the founders in the very early days - your garage moments; Stripe when it was a little further along with a team of eight or ten; Airbnb when they were working out of their own apartment; and Instacart. We work with startups when they are two to three people, just the founders. There are a number of ways in which we help. We talk about three things that are the hardest things about starting a startup: building a product and making something people want, raising money, and hiring a team. I framed this a little bit from your input but also what I wish I knew way back when along my career, even coming out of college. A lot of people ask what's the best way to learn about startups, but one of the best ways to actually learn about startups is to just go work at one. You're not going to be able to experience that unless you really go find one that is interesting, find one where you get along with the founders, and you work at one. If you have multiple years to try different things, then going and working at a startup is one way to learn about startups with a very low risk. If there's anybody who would be a poster child for this, for better or worse, it's me. I was an early engineer at Salesforce. I graduated from college and I got the chance to join a seven-person team, work with the founders, work with Marc Benioff, and work with this gentleman right here Parker Harris - he's one of the co-founders of Salesforce. He taught me a lot about full stack engineering, about running teams, about managing people, and I really got to work with someone who's very experienced. So I got to be pretty darn technical and build the apps top to bottom, and that's something that you get to do at a startup. From there, I then got to be an engineer at a company called Zora, and within a year I ran the engineering team. One thing that we say about working at startups is that at startups sometimes you get more responsibility than you deserve, and so in this case I got to run an engineering team.

简单介绍一下我自己：我是YC前创始人。我几乎整个职业生涯都在初创公司工作，既有小型初创公司，也有大型初创公司。我和我的团队负责YC的"在初创公司工作"项目，这是一个招聘平台，也是找工作的好方法。我们稍后会再详细讨论这一点。如果您不了解YC，我们帮助初创公司获得早期发展。仅举几个通过YC的公司为例：Dropbox，当时Ashton作为创始人在非常早期的阶段——就像在车库创业的时刻；Stripe，当时规模稍大一些，有八到十人的团队；Airbnb，当时他们还在自己的公寓里工作；以及Instacart。我们在初创公司只有两到三个人，仅仅是创始人的时候就与他们合作。我们通过多种方式提供帮助。我们讨论了创业中最困难的三件事：打造产品并制造人们想要的东西、筹集资金以及组建团队。我根据您的意见以及我希望在我职业生涯早期，甚至大学刚毕业时就知道的事情来构建这个框架。很多人问了解初创公司的最佳方式是什么，但实际上了解初创公司的最佳方式之一就是去初创公司工作。除非你真的找到一个有趣的初创公司，找到一个与创始人相处融洽的初创公司，并在那里工作，否则你将无法获得这种体验。如果你有多年的时间尝试不同的事情，那么去初创公司工作是了解初创公司的一种风险很低的方式。如果有人能成为这方面的典型代表，无论好坏，那就是我。我是Salesforce的早期工程师。我大学毕业后有机会加入一个七人团队，与创始人一起工作，与Marc Benioff一起工作，并与这里的这位绅士Parker Harris一起工作——他是Salesforce的联合创始人之一。他教了我很多关于全栈工程、团队管理和人员管理的知识，我真的有机会与一位经验非常丰富的人一起工作。所以我变得相当技术化，能够从头到尾构建应用程序，而这正是你在初创公司能够做到的事情。从那里开始，我后来在一家名为Zora的公司担任工程师，并在一年内负责管理工程团队。关于在初创公司工作，我们常说的一点是，在初创公司有时你会承担超出你应得的责任，所以在这种情况下我得以负责管理一个工程团队。

In this case, I got to run an engineering team in China and manage this gentleman named Lei Jin, who was just one of the most talented engineers I'd ever met. Sometimes I'm like, "You could be my boss," but I'm glad that we're doing this together. I felt in some ways over my skis, but I grew a ton through that experience. That's what working at a startup often gives you. This is a picture of me with the head of engineering at Lyft and that woman Amy Farrow, who was an amazing CSO at one point at Lyft. I got to work with these two people to help take a company public. The last thing is I started my own startup in YC. This is me and my co-founder Kendall at the YC office back in the day when we did our stuff. We got like 125k or something like that, and now YC is getting half a million dollars to start doing. You got a great idea and you're really passionate about it.

在这种情况下，我在中国管理一个工程团队，并管理这位名叫雷金（Lei Jin）的先生，他是我见过的最有才华的工程师之一。有时我会想，"你本可以当我的老板"，但我很高兴我们能一起合作。在某些方面，我感到力不从心，但通过那段经历，我成长了很多。这就是在初创公司工作常常带给你的。这是我和Lyft的工程主管以及那位曾在Lyft担任杰出首席安全官（CSO）的艾米·法罗（Amy Farrow）的合影。我有幸与这两位合作，帮助一家公司上市。最后，我在YC创办了自己的初创公司。这是我和我的联合创始人肯德尔（Kendall）在YC办公室的照片，那是我们当初创业的时候。我们当时拿到了大约12.5万美元之类的资金，而现在YC会提供50万美元来启动项目。如果你有一个好点子并且对此充满热情，那就去做吧。

All right, so a lot of people don't know how startups are different from FAANG. Startups have higher visibility and faster decision making process. You get to see the creation that you make like the next day because you can ship it. Mentorship is kind of toss-up. I think mentorship is not a function of large company or small company, it's a matter of who you'll be working with. So it's up to you to learn who you'll be working with and to in some ways interview the people, interview your manager to know what projects will I be working on, what things do you think are interesting, what are you an expert at that by the end of my summer internship or by working with you for two years am I going to learn. FAANG is low risk, you know there's no doubt about that especially in this economy. That said, some of them are having layoffs and that's hard to track. And startup sites here low to medium risk. People say that startups are high risk and I will say that if you're a Founder yes it's high risk. Could you pick the right one low medium if you pick one that's like later staged and growing and we'll share some of those not really risky at all. And another consideration because it's not just you in a vacuum, FAANG companies you know your family will be very very happy and it's startups your family might not be so happy unless it takes off hard to determine and then they're gonna be stoked. So how do you choose a startup? But one of the things is trying to find the right stage startup for you right not all startups are the same they get lumped into a bucket. People think that the startup that you saw on Silicon Valley is what a startup is and I think we're here to debunk a bit of that myth and help you find one that might be good for you. We talk about startups in these four categories. One is the seed stage startup and this is the one that's most close to the TV show Silicon Valley. It's pre-product, they might not have customers pre-revenue. You know our startups raise one five million dollars so if you're trying to work at a startup um they can pay your salary. The only challenges that like you know is a five person a two-person startup a good fit for you maybe maybe not. In the case of I think it was Kyle at Cruz, he used to work at twitch and I think he was like fresh out of college and he was one of the first early employees. He thought it was a good fit but not everyone is a good fit for these early early stage companies. Also early stage companies are looking for engineers a bit more of a jack of all trade and sometimes Ops.

好的，很多人不知道初创公司与FAANG公司有何不同。初创公司具有更高的可见性和更快的决策流程。你能够很快看到自己的成果，因为第二天就能发布产品。导师指导这方面比较随机。我认为导师指导并不取决于公司规模大小，而是取决于你将与谁共事。所以需要你自己去了解未来的同事，在某种程度上要面试这些人，面试你的经理，了解你将参与什么项目，你认为哪些方面有趣，你擅长什么领域，通过暑期实习或两年共事我能学到什么。FAANG公司风险较低，在当前经济形势下这一点毋庸置疑。不过，其中一些公司也在裁员，这很难预测。而初创公司属于中低风险。人们说初创公司风险高，我认为如果你作为创始人确实风险很高。但如果你选择的是后期阶段且正在发展的公司，风险就是中低级别，我们会分享一些几乎没什么风险的公司。另一个考虑因素是这不仅仅关乎你个人，FAANG公司会让你的家人非常满意，而如果是初创公司，除非它真的起飞了，否则家人可能不会那么开心，这很难判断，但成功后他们就会非常兴奋。那么如何选择初创公司？关键之一是找到适合你的发展阶段，并非所有初创公司都一样，它们常被混为一谈。人们认为《硅谷》电视剧里描绘的就是初创公司的样子，而我们要做的就是破除这种误解，帮你找到适合你的公司。我们将初创公司分为四类。第一类是种子期初创公司，这最接近《硅谷》电视剧里的形象。它们处于产品前阶段，可能还没有客户和收入。你知道我们的初创公司能融资一百到五百万美元，所以如果你想在初创公司工作，他们能支付你的薪水。唯一的挑战是，一个五人甚至两人的初创公司是否适合你，可能适合也可能不适合。以Cruz公司的Kyle为例，他曾在Twitch工作，我记得他刚大学毕业，是早期员工之一。他认为这很适合自己，但并非所有人都适合这些非常早期的公司。此外，早期公司更倾向于寻找全能型工程师，有时还需要负责运维工作。

If you're looking for Ops roles or something that is more like operational, imagine Instacart in the early days. They need people running around DoorDash, they need people running around doing deliveries, talking to restaurants right. It's a matter of you selling what you can do for them, but like they're those opportunities where operations keep a good fit. You know you have fewer sales, you have fewer product roles, and that's because we tell the founders to do it themselves.

如果你在寻找运营类职位或更偏向运营性质的工作，可以想象早期的Instacart。他们需要有人负责DoorDash的运营，需要有人负责配送服务，与餐厅沟通。关键在于你要向他们展示你能为他们做什么，但这类运营机会通常比较合适。你知道销售职位较少，产品职位也较少，这是因为我们建议创始人亲自处理这些事务。

Serious days where it gets a little bigger, it's where they've raised maybe five to twenty million dollars. We can see some that are like 30 or 40 at these days. The companies are a little larger, there is a hint of something possibly working, and that's like a hint called Product Market fit. Does the product actually have customers and is there enough demand that instead of you trying to get it out there pushing people your products, the products are selling themselves? The entities actually pulling you along with it, you're getting inbound calls and asks like "hey can I use your product", "hey where do I pay for this thing".

当公司发展到更重要的阶段，规模稍大时，通常是他们已融资500万到2000万美元的时候。如今我们看到有些公司融资额达到3000万或4000万美元。公司规模更大一些，有迹象表明某些方面可能正在奏效，这就像是产品市场契合的迹象。产品是否真正拥有客户？是否有足够的需求，以至于不再需要你费力推广产品，而是产品自行销售？实际上，实体正在推动你前进，你会接到主动咨询的电话，比如"嘿，我能使用你们的产品吗"，"嘿，我在哪里支付这个产品"。

Then we have two other categories which are growth and scale. Growth is definitely where this product Market fits, so it's like how do we get all the customers that we know that are out there using our products, maybe it's 50 to 500 people. This is where they're hiring for so many roles: Ops, customer support, more specialization. Scale is Market expansion, we usually think like going International or using Partnerships to find new ways to get new customers. Companies with 500 people you're getting like half a billion dollars of investment, and they're hiring for everything.

然后我们还有另外两个类别：增长和规模化。增长阶段肯定是产品市场契合的地方，所以问题在于如何让所有我们知道的目标客户使用我们的产品，可能是50到500人。这是他们大量招聘各种职位的时候：运营、客户支持、更多专业职位。规模化是市场扩张，我们通常考虑国际化或利用合作伙伴关系寻找获取新客户的新途径。拥有500名员工的公司通常能获得约5亿美元的投资，他们正在招聘所有类型的职位。

If you're able to get a job, what should you focus on at your job/internship? The number one thing I say is understand the business and measure your impact. Too many people go in and don't know anything about the business, don't want to know anything about the business, and that's a missed opportunity especially if you're at a startup. The second thing is if they give you something media to work on, you want to be able to measure that so you can put it back on your resume for your next job that you're trying to land right. And why wouldn't you want to know that you're actually having a positive contribution? So role by role, if you're in marketing, you know your responsibility is you're supposed to build a pipeline for sales.

如果你能获得一份工作，你在工作/实习中应该关注什么？我认为最重要的事情是了解业务并衡量你的影响。太多人入职时对业务一无所知，也不想去了解业务，这是一个错失的机会，尤其是在初创公司。第二件事是，如果他们给你一些媒体相关的工作，你要能够衡量其效果，这样你就可以将其写入简历，为你下一份目标工作做准备。而且，你为什么不想知道自己是否真正做出了积极贡献呢？因此，按职位来说，如果你从事市场营销，你知道你的职责是为销售建立渠道。

If you're looking for Ops roles or something that is more like operational or growth, the more that you can measure the number of companies you reach out to, the number that actually connect, and the number that go into a sales funnel. If you're going out and doing driver acquisition for DoorDash or Lyft, measure the number of people that you talk to, the number of flyers you hand out, the number that converts to an actual user, and the number that actually activate and drive. Marketing is about populating a funnel, and that's what you should be measuring. Please do not make it about social media and Instagram, the number of posts, and the number of likes unless it converts in a way that you can measure right.

Sales is about revenue. You are trying to get sales for the company. If you can get people to buy and pay, then that's where sales is. That's where your role of sales is going to shine.

Products have different types of roles and responsibilities, but ultimately if you were a mini CEO, you care about the growth of the business. Maybe that's the conversion funnel of the number of people that turn into drivers and help you make money. Maybe it's retention because they're using the product over and over again. If you're an ads company, that means that eyeballs equal ad revenue. Or maybe it's literally just about revenue. Product is the most variant because it really is tied to understanding the business and making sure that you are measuring and improving the business.

Engineering is about impact. This is a tricky one because I think engineers are the only ones who can work at a company, not have an impact, and still get promoted because they did what the product manager said, even if the product manager was wrong. That said, even still focusing on the impact that you're having on the business, having the systems making them more efficient, processing more tickets, whatever the case might be, will benefit you because then you can say that you have a demonstrable impact to the product. You understand that, and startups love that kind of stuff. Startups love people who can understand the product, understand the business, and talk to customers because it just helps things move faster versus needing to build a PRD and then splitting it up over the next nine months to build these things.

如果你正在寻找运营职位或更偏向运营和增长的岗位，你需要尽可能多地衡量接触的公司数量、实际建立联系的数量以及进入销售漏斗的数量。如果你外出为DoorDash或Lyft进行司机招募，就要统计你交谈的人数、分发的传单数量、转化为实际用户的数量以及实际激活并开始驾驶的人数。市场营销的核心在于填充漏斗，这才是你应该衡量的指标。请不要把重点放在社交媒体和Instagram上，不要过分关注发帖数量和点赞数量，除非这些能够以可衡量的方式实现转化。

销售的核心是收入。你是在为公司争取销售业绩。如果你能让人们购买并付款，这才是销售的本质所在。这也是你销售角色能够发光发热的地方。

产品岗位有不同的类型和职责，但最终如果你是一个迷你CEO，你会关心业务的增长。这可能是指转化为司机并帮助你赚钱的人数转化漏斗。也可能是用户留存，因为他们反复使用产品。如果你在一家广告公司，那就意味着眼球数量等于广告收入。或者可能纯粹就是关于收入。产品岗位是最多变的，因为它确实与理解业务密切相关，并确保你正在衡量和改进业务。

工程的核心是影响力。这是一个棘手的问题，因为我认为工程师是唯一可以在公司工作、没有产生实际影响却仍然获得晋升的人，因为他们按照产品经理的要求做事，即使产品经理是错的。话虽如此，即使如此，专注于你对业务产生的影响，让系统更高效，处理更多工单，无论具体情况如何，都会对你有益，因为这样你就可以说自己对产品产生了可证明的影响。你理解这一点，而初创公司喜欢这样的人。初创公司喜欢那些能够理解产品、理解业务并与客户交流的人，因为这有助于事情更快推进，而不是需要先编写产品需求文档，然后将其拆分到未来九个月来构建这些东西。

Like early Airbnb experience, a lot of people think that you have to have a ton of stuff built and the whole product. You just need to have the hustle and the grit to get the proof that this might be a real thing. What does YC look for in a startup? I'll share some things in an oversimplified version. Number one is domain experience and a passion for an industry. If you start a startup, you have to be willing to duke it out for 10 years and work with the same team or the same founders for five to ten years. Having that passion for the industry, wanting to work with your friends, and especially domain experience gives you an advantage. These are super helpful for you to have and be an expert on when you start a startup. Otherwise, you're competing with people who probably already have this experience.

就像早期的爱彼迎经历一样，很多人认为你必须构建大量功能和完整产品。实际上你只需要有拼搏精神和毅力来证明这可能是一个真正可行的项目。YC在初创公司中寻找什么？我将分享一些简化版的要点。第一是领域经验和对行业的热情。如果你创办初创公司，必须愿意奋斗10年，并愿意与同一团队或同一批创始人合作五到十年。对行业的热情、希望与朋友共事，特别是领域经验能给你带来优势。这些在你创办初创公司时非常有帮助，能让你成为专家。否则，你将与可能已经拥有这些经验的人竞争。

YC also likes technical members of the team, but there's a question mark because in the past it used to be really helpful to have an all-technical team. One reason is you can live longer if you're burning less money when everyone is technical, especially if you have to pivot and start over. We have founders who are sales experts and know so much about the sales process, having already made 10 million dollars in annual recurring revenue. Hiring an engineering team once they've raised 20 million dollars is a lot easier. So we have many non-technical startups now. If you're not technical and looking for a founder, you should check out Startup School run by YC, and we have this program called co-founder matching that might help you find a technical founder.

YC也喜欢团队中的技术成员，但这存在疑问，因为过去拥有全技术团队确实非常有帮助。原因之一是如果每个人都是技术背景，在资金消耗较少的情况下可以支撑更久，特别是在需要转型和重新开始时。我们有作为销售专家的创始人，他们非常了解销售流程，已经实现了1000万美元的年度经常性收入。一旦他们筹集到2000万美元，招聘工程团队就会容易得多。所以我们现在有很多非技术背景的初创公司。如果你不是技术背景且正在寻找联合创始人，你应该查看YC运营的初创学校，我们有一个名为联合创始人匹配的项目，可能帮助你找到技术创始人。

Do you need a prototype? It turns out that you don't need a prototype, but the caveat is: if you're passionate about the idea and you're technical, why haven't you built a prototype to try it out, go to customers, get feedback, and iterate? Another thing that YC is not necessarily looking for is the next billion-dollar business. We're looking for strong founders who can build things, talk to customers, iterate quickly, and eventually grow into a billion-dollar business. It sounds weird, but this is a team that did it. It's a team called Stagnant and their first product actually targeted at

你需要原型吗？事实证明你不需要原型，但需要注意的是：如果你对这个想法充满热情并且具备技术背景，为什么你还没有构建原型来尝试、接触客户、获取反馈并进行迭代？YC不一定寻找的另一个东西是下一个十亿美元业务。我们寻找的是能够构建产品、与客户沟通、快速迭代并最终成长为十亿美元业务的强大创始人。这听起来很奇怪，但有一个团队做到了。这是一个名为Stagnant的团队，他们的第一个产品实际上针对

So lastly, and I said I'd come back to this, what does YC do to help and what are the things you will need as a founder of a startup? Number one, you will need help building your product. Part of that is personalized advice with one-on-one office hours from former founders and YC Partners who have done it before and talked to tens of thousands of companies and have pretty good pattern matching of what works and doesn't work. We have a secret startup handbook with 20 years of YC knowledge - no joke, it keeps getting better. It's so much better even than the one I did when I was eight years ago. There's a YC network of 8,000 alumni. There's a secret bookbase software, a secret kind of social network and fundraising tool. The whole batch is run on our software. Startups are hardened, so these are the types of things that YC offers that gives startups an advantage. There's five hundred thousand dollars in discounts and offers from Amazon, Google, and other YC companies to help you get your startup off the ground. And then YC isn't just three months - there's alumni events, workshops, conferences. We actually just ran an alumni event for all YC alumni. We rented out Spark Social in San Francisco - it was an awesome time, you'll see a lot of people who tweeted about it. And then we have later stage programs. If you're lucky enough or skilled enough to build a startup that goes through Series A or growth, we have programs where we re-batch founders to make it feel like a smaller YC but with people who are CEOs of half-billion to billion dollar companies. We help you raise money, so we offer $500,000 right off the bat, which we used to do $125,000 but now five hundred thousand dollars. It's a pretty compelling option, an alternative to working at another company. And some people are like, oh, that'll actually help a ton. Most of our companies raise two to four million plus even in this economy. And then we have the ability to write hundred thousand to hundred million dollar checks later. We teach companies demo days where we bring thousands of investors to your doorstep to invest. We give you pitch practice, we give you advice to make intros, and then we have a pretty wide investor network to help you raise. We also do this other thing that when other founders in your batch finish their fundraising, we asked those founders to make intros to the other YC companies, and that works really well. So the network effect is real in YC. And lastly, we help you build your team. We do team building training, we have hiring conferences, we run Hacker News.

最后，正如我之前说要回到这个话题的，YC提供什么帮助，以及作为初创公司创始人你需要什么？首先，你需要产品构建方面的帮助。其中部分包括来自前创始人和YC合伙人的一对一办公时间个性化建议，他们之前做过这些，与数万家公司交流过，对什么有效什么无效有很好的模式识别能力。我们有一本包含20年YC知识的秘密创业手册——不开玩笑，它一直在变得更好。甚至比我八年前参与时好得多。有一个8000名校友的YC网络。有一个秘密的书籍库软件，一种秘密的社交网络和融资工具。整个批次都在我们的软件上运行。初创公司因此变得更强大，这些就是YC提供的能给初创公司带来优势的东西。来自亚马逊、谷歌和其他YC公司的折扣和优惠总计50万美元，帮助你启动创业。YC不仅仅是三个月——还有校友活动、工作坊、会议。我们实际上刚刚为所有YC校友举办了一个校友活动。我们在旧金山租下了Spark Social——那是个很棒的时刻，你会看到很多人发推文谈论它。然后我们有后期阶段项目。如果你足够幸运或有足够技能建立一个经历A轮融资或增长阶段的初创公司，我们有重新分组创始人的项目，让它感觉像一个小型YC，但成员是五亿到十亿美元公司的CEO们。我们帮助你融资，所以我们一开始就提供50万美元，过去是12.5万美元，但现在提供五十万美元。这是一个相当有吸引力的选择，是去其他公司工作的替代方案。有些人会说，哦，这实际上帮助很大。我们的大多数公司即使在当前经济环境下也能融资200万到400万美元以上。然后我们有能力在后期开出十万到一亿美元的支票。我们教公司演示日，把数千名投资者带到你家门口投资。我们提供路演练习，提供介绍建议，然后我们有一个相当广泛的投资者网络来帮助你融资。我们还做另一件事：当你批次中的其他创始人完成融资后，我们请这些创始人向其他YC公司做介绍，这效果非常好。所以YC的网络效应是真实存在的。最后，我们帮助你建立团队。我们进行团队建设培训，举办招聘会议，我们运营Hacker News。

So we help use Hacker News in terms of Hacker News launches and access to slash jobs to help you hire. What I see companies can do is that we run work at a startup. We run these events: internship programs, tech talks, expos. And these are the things that are the hardest. The three hardest things about starting a startup are building product, raising money, and hiring a team. And YC helps on all fronts.

我们通过Hacker News的发布和访问slash jobs功能来帮助您招聘。我看到公司可以这样做：我们在初创企业运营工作。我们举办这些活动：实习项目、技术讲座、博览会。这些都是最困难的事情。创办初创公司最困难的三件事是打造产品、筹集资金和组建团队。YC在所有方面都能提供帮助。
